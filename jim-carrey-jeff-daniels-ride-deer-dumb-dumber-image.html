But the bar was already low for&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Dumb and Dumber To</strong></a>,&nbsp;so there’s not much farther that it could sink. Starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels reprising their roles as Lloyd and Harry from the first <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>,&nbsp;Dumb and Dumber To&nbsp;is pretty much set up to be…dumb.</p><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Today sees the release of the first official image of our favorite idiots and it depicts them sitting on the back of a deer statue, making absurd faces. Not much to go on there, except that ten years appears to have done nothing to get these guys out of adolescence. The plot of Dumb and Dumber To also opens a path for all kinds of shenanigans, as the boys go on the road again so that Harry can find his illegitimate daughter and give her a kidney transplant. Brilliant. There’s no way this can go wrong.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>The Farrelly Brothers are back to write and direct&nbsp;Dumb and Dumber To&nbsp;with their usual elegance, style, and aplomb. Although both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels have proved themselves much better actors and comedians than the original film would suggest, it could be fun to see them doing some basic gross-out comedy again. Of course, the last time the Farrellys stepped behind the camera we got&nbsp;The Three Stooges, which I think we would all do well to forget.</p><p data-characters=73 data-current-count=73 data-injectable=false>Dumb and Dumber To will cavort its way onto the screen November 14, 2014.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>You can check out the first official image from the film&nbsp;below and let us know what you think about the sequel in the comments. Are you going to head to theatres in November to experience Harry and Lloyd once more?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooaKlXZius77EsmSjnZabeqWtzaKcpatdp7alsYydnJ6qXZnCrq6MnaymmpWneqq5wKCcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-all-soda-coke.html><span>←</span><span>Is all soda Coke?</span></a>
