<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>The Legend Of Bagger Vance movie review (2000)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>I am not a golfer. It doesn't matter. Golf or any game is not about the rules or tools, but about how you conduct yourself. Civilized games make civilized societies. You look at the movie and you see that if athletes are not gentlemen and gentlewomen, there is no reason to watch them. <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a> is a gentleman. Roger Clemens is not. You see how it works.</p><p>"The Legend of Bagger Vance" takes place in Savannah, Ga., in the first years of the Depression. A man builds a great golf course, goes broke and shoots himself. His daughter Adele (<a href=#>Charlize Theron</a>) faces ruin, but risks everything on a $10,000 tournament. She invites the two greatest golfers in the world: Bobby Jones (<a href=#>Joel Gretsch</a>) and Walter Hagen (<a href=#>Bruce McGill</a>). And she also persuades Rannulph Junuh (<a href=#>Matt Damon</a>), who was the greatest player in Savannah until he went off to World War I and something broke inside. He spent the 1920s drinking and playing poker.</p><p>Junuh doesn't much want to return to golf, which for him also means returning to civilization and to his own better nature. Three people encourage him. One is Adele. Before the war they were in love. One is a boy named Hardy (J. Michael Moncrief) who dreams about golf. And one is Bagger Vance (<a href=#>Will Smith</a>), a caddy who appears out of nowhere and assigns himself to the rehabilitation and education of Rannulph Junuh.</p><p>We have here the elements for a cruder movie. We can imagine how Jones and Hagen could be painted as hard-edged professionals, how the caddy could be sketched with broad strokes like some kind of an angel in a sitcom, how the little kid could be made insufferable and cute, how Adele and Junuh could fight and make up and fight, all according to the outlines they hand out in screenwriting class.</p><p>That's not how this movie goes. Nothing in it is pushed too far; it is a masterpiece of tact. Not even the outcome of the tournament is pumped up for effect; quietly, the movie suggests that how the tournament is won is more important than who wins it. As for the romance, it's in a minor key good for regret and tremulous hope; Charlize Theron's wise, sweet Adele handles Junuh like a man she wants to teach about tenderness.</p><p>Every actor makes the point, and then pauses, content. Matt Damon's Junuh is not a comeback hero but a man who seems surprised to be playing golf. Jones and Hagen are not the good cop and the bad cop. They're both good--sportsmen who love the game but don't talk a lot about it. Jones is handsome, a golden boy. Hagen is dark and has a gut and smokes all the time. Jones plays a beautiful game. Hagen is always getting into trouble and saving himself. Both of them are . . . having fun. Just fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lnJq0prrDZqafZZKWtKix0WatmqaTmnpzfI9p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zelda-ocarina-time-master-quest-changes-differences-harder.html><span>←</span><span>Ocarina Of Time's Master Quest Differences Explained</span></a>
