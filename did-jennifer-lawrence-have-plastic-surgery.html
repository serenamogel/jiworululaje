Around 2011, fans noticed that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hunger Games</a> star‚Äôs nose was more linear than in previous years, which Lawrence herself attributed to a rhinoplasty procedure. At the time, Lawrence said the surgery was for medical purposes rather than cosmetic, to amend her deviated septum.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=711 data-injectable=true>The effect altered the overall profile of her nose, which is now enviably sleek. Moving down the face, fans were also quick to suggest that Lawrence has had lip fillers, given the gradual plumpness of her lips throughout the years. While she has yet to confirm this procedure, the surgeons over at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MYA Cosmetic Surgery</a> speculate that she has had some form of lip filler.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>no way jennifer lawrence got plastic surgery <a href=#>https://t.co/hcfw6vd7BZ</a></p>‚Äî ‚ô°GiuüåïSTSG brainrot (@xiugiu1) <a href=#>September 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Lawrence‚Äôs lips look fuller now than in previous ones, which can be attributed to some nifty makeup tricks like over-lining or plump gloss or a dermal filler procedure. Plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Youn believes Lawrence has had lip filler, telling&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Skin Care Edit</a>&nbsp;that she has likely received lip injectables to achieve her ‚Äúnice plump pout.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Though she likewise hasn‚Äôt confirmed the procedure, it‚Äôs also likely that ‚Äî like everyone in Hollywood (and even this writer) ‚Äî Lawrence has had some form of Botox.
