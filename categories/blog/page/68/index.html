The movie opens with a brief flash-forward. Government assassin&nbsp;Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) blasts his trainee, David Mason (Luke Bracey), for disobeying orders in an operation that was supposed to thwart an assassination but ended up causing a child's death. Five years later, David is ordered to kill a&nbsp;former Russian double-agent named Natalia (played by Mediha Musilovic)&nbsp;who broke into the office of the&nbsp;soon-to-be-elected president, Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski). Why? Without giving too much away, let's just say that the CIA is up to no good, as is so often the case in movies and life, and that a self-interested power broker inside the agency wants to prevent the information that Natalia stole from getting out and&nbsp;embarrassing&nbsp;the agency.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bharti Singh Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>Feb 18, 2024</time>
