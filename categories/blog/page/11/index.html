<a href=../../../../can-you-send-pictures-with-cleavage-to-inmates.html></a>
Answer: NO. Very few facilities allow nudity or anything that could be considered sexually explicit photos. To play it safe, make sure all subjects are fully clothed with no cleavage. What kind of pictures can I send to an inmate? Photos should be no larger than 4"x6" Always print the inmates name and ID number on the back of the photo in pen (this helps the mail room staff) Photos should never contain nudity, sexually suggestive material.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Katie Mylove Nazir Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
