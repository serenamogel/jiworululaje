Take Back the Land of Wano,” that would put Zuko from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>&nbsp;to shame. In it, this Straw Hat Pirate transformed to his Gear 5 form to not only grab lightning, but also use it to his advantage during his battle against Kaidou. Luffy’s rubber attributes not only protect him from the electric shock but also help him redirect attacks towards his opponent. When all was said and done, there wasn’t a single scratch on him when he used this powerful technique.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Fans were shocked (no pun intended) over on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">r/OnePiece</a>,&nbsp;and the video’s comment section with how this scene came to life. Some noticed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the absurdity of this episode</a>&nbsp;and explained that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it doesn’t need to be explained or analyzed</a>. At the end of the day, people were entertained and were impressed by Toei Animation’s ability to produce this epic moment from the manga and translate it to the screen.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>What makes the whole scene feel epic, yet keeping it within the spirit of&nbsp;One Piece‘s story is how much fun Luffy had during that combat sequence. While he did give the fight 100 percent, he didn’t seem afraid and smiled all the way through.</p><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece has many notable moments.</a> However, this battle with Kaidou isn’t the last this series has to offer. While this battle sequence is amazing and visually heavy, he and the rest of the straw hat pirates still have more adventures ahead of them. Season 20 follows the “Wano Country Saga” and the series’ author,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eiichiro Oda is currently working on the final events</a>&nbsp;that will conclude this over two-decade-long story. It will be interesting to see how the final battle could possibly top this epic match-up that was witnessed recently.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>If you want to watch this epic duel in its entirety, this latest episode of&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;is available to stream on Crunchyroll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6opZ5loJ6ypLGMpJyeqKNitKbA06KloGWdpL%2BmedKtrKemmaO0bq3SZqOunpaueqy1wqSqZqGeqbxus8SaqWZtXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khloe-kardashian-on-why-she-didnt-give-baby-true-middle-name.html><span>←</span><span>Khlo Kardashian on Why She Didn't Give True Thompson a Middle Name</span></a>
