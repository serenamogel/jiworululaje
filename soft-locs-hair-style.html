Though similar to dreadlocks, soft locs are a great temporary alternative if you're not ready to make a long-term commitment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The key to getting the soft locs hairstyle is the type of hair used," said celebrity hairstylist Erinn Courtney, who can be booked on<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>StyleSeat</a>.

So you'll be pleased to know that soft locs can be pretty quick — they take anywhere from two to five hours to install, depending on the length and size of the locs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Soft locs can be done individually by wrapping hair around the natural hair or crocheting pre-made soft locs into cornrows," said Courtney.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The key to perfecting soft locs is the type of hair used.

Firstly, you can't jump into bed without covering your soft locs as they'll become frizzy and possibly start to loosen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Courtney, the best way to care for soft locs is to wear a silk or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>satin bonnet</a>&nbsp;or scarf at night to prevent the soft locs from getting frizzy while you sleep. The hairstylist also recommended wearing a shower cap while showering to prevent the soft locs from getting wet, as this can cause them to slip down your natural hair and expose frizzy roots after drying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keeping your hair hydrated is also important when caring for your soft locs. Even though your natural hair is not exposed, it still needs moisture to stay healthy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Use necessary hydrating products to ensure your hair is staying healthy and moisturized and to protect the strands of the soft locs from fraying," said Courtney.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-wash></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Wash</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram / @shesplushh</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Washing soft locs may seem tricky, but it's really not that hard.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best way to wash soft locs is to focus your fingertips on the scalp only and let the shampoo wash down the loc without manipulating it," said Courtney. "Creating too much friction on the locs will cause them to loosen and eventually come undone."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-and-how-to-remove></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When and How to Remove</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Instagram / @protect_yo_strands</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soft locs can last anywhere from four to six weeks and are a great option to give your hair a break from heat treatment and other processes. However, it's recommended that you don't leave the style in much longer than this period. If you do, the added weight of extra hair on the head can pull on your roots. That excessive tension can cause stress on your scalp, leading to weakened roots and breakage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You'll know it's time to remove your soft locs when the roots of your hair have grown out significantly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The synthetic hair added to create the loc will become heavy and pull on the natural root," said Courtney. "At this point, you should remove the locs to prevent any damage."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to taking out soft locs, we have some good news — removing them is quicker than installing. Courtney recommended cutting the locs about six inches under your natural hair and unraveling them from there; this will ensure you don't cut your actual hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You can also use conditioner to help soften the hair as this will help the soft locs to slide out," she added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-cost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Cost</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Soft locs can cost between $200 to $400 to install, depending on the location, length of your locs, and your stylist's skill level.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.&nbsp;From the kinkiest coils to loose waves, we're celebrating natural hair in its many forms by sharing expert tips for styling, maintenance, and haircare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eRobluusCtrKuZnGTAsLLTZqOom6NitaK10WaqrbGcmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./phone-booth-2003.html><span>←</span><span>Phone Booth movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2003)</span></a>
