Darnell Taylor‘s sad story is a series of missed opportunities that, had adults in Taylor’s life acted differently, could have had a different outcome. It began in 2022, when Ohio police checked on the preschooler while in his mother’s care, and ended when the then 5-year-old was found dead two years later.

The police responded to the call, and Taylor’s mother — whose name has not been released in the press — said she was punishing her son for calling her a bad name, and that he’d only been outside for about five minutes, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Columbus Dispatch</a>.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>Taylor’s mother also made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suicidal and homicidal remarks</a> to the police during that visit, and was taken into custody for a mental health evaluation. Taylor, meanwhile, was placed in the custody of his grandparents, Anthony and Tawanda Baynes. The little boy reportedly proved too much for them to handle, so they turned to a family friend, Pammy Maye, for help. By the summer of 2023, Maye had legal custody of the boy, but in Feb. 2024, Maye’s husband called 911: Taylor and Maye <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were missing.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-was-darnell-taylor-found data-injectable=false>Where was Darnell Taylor found?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>NBC4 Columbus/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=809 data-injectable=true>According to the Columbus news outlet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">10TV.com</a>, Pammy Maye’s husband said his wife covered his mouth and told him “she had a plan” before she took Darnell Taylor and vanished. Maye’s husband said he feared Taylor was no longer alive, and an Amber alert was issued. Days later, Maye was found wandering in a Cleveland suburb in a nightgown. A short time later, Taylor was found dead in a sewer drain. His cause of death was suffocation, and Maye was charged with Taylor’s murder.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Taylor’s grandparents referred to Maye, who was 48 when Taylor died, as “a family friend.” Reportedly, she lived with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
