His MTV show Totally Pauly made him one of the most famous comedy sensations of his time. After that, though, he had to deal with many personal and professional issues—including losing his loved ones and rumors regarding his sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>All of this led to a gradual decline in his career success over the years until the comedian finally made a comeback a couple of years back.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Shore Had to Bear the Loss of Several of His Loved Ones in the Past Two Decades</h2><p>In wide contrast to the cheerful teen actor people had grown to love, Shore suddenly succumbed to solemn sadness in 1994. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The cause of that was the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">death</a> of his ex-girlfriend Shannon Wilsey, who committed suicide in July 1994. Wilsey, whose pseudonym in the adult entertainment world was&nbsp;Savannah, shot herself in the head just hours after crashing her car. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>She became Savannah. She became her character, who was into drugs, and needed reassurance all the time. She forgot who Shannon was.</p><p>That was only the first among a series of tragedies that would befall the actor. In 2018 and 2019, the comedian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mourned</a> the death of his family members and friends. He lost&nbsp;his beloved mother, Mitzi, and sister&nbsp;in 2018. He also lost&nbsp;his father, comedian Sammy, in 2019.</p><p>My journey made me realize, You need to look at what you have...not what you don't have.</p><h2>The Comedian's Personal&nbsp;Loss&nbsp;Affected His Career</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Shore's personal slump&nbsp;seems to have carried&nbsp;over to his career, too. After the 90s, his workflow steadily declined, and speaking with Page Six in October 2020, he&nbsp;even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed</a> his dejection over being cast in lesser-known movies. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I was sad because I just loved making people happy,” he stated.</p><p>The actor was also seen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reminiscing</a> his old movies through social media posts this past year, often <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">asking</a> filmmakers to sequel his old movies.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>He Recently Made a Comeback in Hollywood</h2><p>After a decade-long hiatus, Shore finally got cast in the comedy movie&nbsp;Guest House, where he played the role of a party animal. He expressed his excitement about his upcoming movie in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Inverse</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He said,&nbsp;“I'm excited to come out and star in a movie. It's been a while for me…”</p><p>Besides Guest House, Shore is also part of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">other projects</a> like Pauly Shore’s Random Rants,&nbsp;Pauly Shore’s Rancho Cuatro, Stick With The Dancing, and All things Comedy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Podcast</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed</a> his willingness to make a&nbsp;sequel to&nbsp;Encino Man, a movie that made him a household name, while speaking to Screenrant in November 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Comedian Called Himself Gay on Social Media</h2><p>Even though Shore is slowly regaining his career success, he does not seem to be doing so well in his dating life. Relationships never really worked out for Shore —&nbsp;he constantly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">jumped between</a> women without ever settling on one. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While the actor was never at the end of any gay rumors as such, his&nbsp;"I'm gay now. Any first responders?" <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> on Facebook seemed to allude to his sexual orientation&nbsp;drew in a lot of attention.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Whether he was serious or just joking is up for speculation, but it did stir&nbsp;up a wave of rumors surrounding his sexuality.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>That being said, his past relationship with women suggests that he is definitely straight. According to Who Dated Who, he has had dated former adult star&nbsp;Jewel De'Nyle, the Australian singer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kylie Minogue</a>, actress&nbsp;Jill St. Marks, and American actress&nbsp;Tiffani Thiessen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoJbCrcWMrJ%2BoqpVitKLFjaGrpqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-wachtenheim.html><span>←</span><span>David Wachtenheim movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
