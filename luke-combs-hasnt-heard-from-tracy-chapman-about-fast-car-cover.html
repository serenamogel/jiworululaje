However, the country singer says prior approval&nbsp;was not required for this cover.</p><p>“For a cover you don’t have to seek approval, but it’s very, very specific what you can and can’t do,” Combs explains. “There are licenses for a lot of things. I can’t make any videos — I can’t do a music video.”</p><p>“I couldn’t promo that before the album came out,” he continues. “I couldn’t be like ‘it’s gonna have “Fast Car” on it and it’s gonna be sick.'”</p><p>Combs did not say if he had reached out to Chapman prior to recording the song. He did, however, reveal that royalties must be paid to a song’s writer, even with a cover.</p><p>“You just have to, you know, pay the royalties to the writer to do a cover, because once the song is released, it’s kind of … it’s out in the free market in the sense of you can cover it and you just have to pay the royalties on it,” he details.</p><p>“But there are so many things, like I can’t license it to a TV show, because I don’t own the publishing on it,” he explains.</p><p>This may prevent Combs from performing what has become one of his biggest releases at any upcoming awards shows, unless he gets the green light from Chapman.&nbsp;Of course, there’s still a chance he could persuade her to join him for the performance, or even a new duet version of the song.</p><p>Combs’ version of “Fast Car” has&nbsp;put&nbsp;Chapman back on the Billboard charts in 2023. She now has her first No. 1 on the Billboard Country Songwriters <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">chart</a> as the sole credited writer. The song also topped Billboard’s Country Airplay <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">chart</a>, also a first for her.</p><p>The cover is also tracking to be a No. 1 on Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100 chart.</p><p>The “Love You Anyway” singer has been a fan of the song since he was a child listening to Chapman’s album on cassette with his father.&nbsp;Combs has been covering the song on social media since 2020, and he included the official recording on his Gettin’ Old album.</p><p>“It was never the goal for it to blow up the way that it did,”&nbsp;he&nbsp;confesses.</p><p>“You can’t really predict, you know, what’s gonna take off,”&nbsp;Combs continues, “And then in the age of TikTok, man, things can take off so much faster than ever before. I mean, they can cake off truly overnight.”</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 20 Luke Combs Songs That Prove ‘Em All Wrong</h2><p>Check out Luke Combs’ best songs, and the songs that changed his life when so many thought he wasn’t good enough to be a country star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGijrqOVYrCwucGsZKGZo6PBbrTEmqmdZZanvK5506uYnLFdmLWivMyapWaZkqTCtXnFmqqtZZOWv26vzq%2Bcq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-pork-parents-where-are-they-from-family-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>John Pork Parents | Where Are They From | Family and Net Worth</span></a>
