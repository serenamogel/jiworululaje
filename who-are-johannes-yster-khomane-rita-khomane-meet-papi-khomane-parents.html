<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Who Are Johannes Yster Khomane &amp;amp; Rita Khomane? Meet Papi Khomane Parents</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>While we commemorate the former Orlando Pirates captain for his ability and accomplishments, it is also important to recognize the foundation built by <strong>Papi Khomane’s parents.</strong> On Saturday, November 25, 2023, the former South African star perished in a vehicle accident with his mother and uncle. Papi Khomane, born on January 31, 1975, made an unforgettable imprint as a professional defender.</p><p>His career started with Jomo Cosmos, where he made an astounding 91 appearances between 1994 and 1998. His transfer to the Orlando Pirates in 1998, however, established his legacy. Papi was a key player for the Buccaneers for nine years. He appeared in over 150 games and represented the attitude of a real Buccaneer both on and off the field. Papi also played for the South African national team from 1998 to 2000, making a significant appearance at AFCON 2000. Unfortunately, a chronic knee condition caused him to retire in 2007. After retiring, he coached the Pirates again and served as a soccer commentator on SABC Sporta until his death on November 25, 2023.</p><h2>Papi Khomane Parents</h2><p>Behind every successful person lies a solid foundation formed by their family. <strong>Papi Khomane’s parents, Johannes Yster Khomane and Rita Khomane</strong> were the foundation in developing the man we know today.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Papi-Khomane-1.jpg alt="Papi Khomane" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Get to know Father Johannes “Yster” Khomane</h2><p>The name Johannes “Yster” Khomane, a Bucs legend in his own right, was Papi’s rock of strength and leadership. The father-son combo established a distinct legacy for the Orlando Pirates, which is unusual in the club’s history. Yster Khomane, who played for the Buccaneers in the late 1970s, was a well-known right-back. His career also includes stops at the Pimville United Brothers (PUBS) and the Moroka Swallows, where he demonstrated his defensive abilities.</p><p>Yster gained the moniker ‘Iron’ from teammates and spectators owing to his physical strength and endurance. He was known for his hard-tackling, aerial abilities, and leadership qualities.&nbsp;Similarly, he was captain of the Orlando Pirates for numerous years, contributing to the club’s greatest period.&nbsp;Notably, the renowned defender assisted the Pirates in winning multiple trophies, including the NPSL championship and the Mainstay Cup.&nbsp;In addition, he appeared in the 1980 Mainstay Cup final versus Moroka Swallows, which was chosen the fan favorite match of the decade.&nbsp;When questioned about his kid, Yster recalls with fondness the joy he had seeing Papi firmly mark opponents like Pollen “Trompies” Ndlanya.</p><h2>Meet Papi Khomane Mother, Rita Khomane</h2><p><strong>Rita Khomane, Papi’s mother</strong>, was instrumental in supporting both her husband and son.&nbsp;While her name may not be as well-known, her impact on Papi’s life was tremendous.&nbsp;Rita’s loving personality gave Papi the stability and affection he needed to drive his dreams.&nbsp;Her participation at Orlando home games highlighted her devotion and love for the game.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Papi-Khomane-2.jpg alt="Papi Khomane" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rita’s influence in shaping Papi’s character was crucial as the quiet power behind the Khomane family.&nbsp;Furthermore, she contributed to the father-son duo’s success and legacy inside the Orlando Pirates brotherhood.&nbsp;In remembering Papi Khomane, the soccer world will always recognize the significant achievements of his parents, Johannes and Rita Khomane.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2Bmecmon5qmnprAbsXSrZyrZZudvK6tzZ5kq6GklnqstM6mmKedXaKypsCMqZipoV2gtbC5wKecZqiRp7KvwNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./walter-pidgeon.html><span>←</span><span>Walter Pidgeon movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
