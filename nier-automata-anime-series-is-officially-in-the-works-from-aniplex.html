The surviving humans have taken refuge on the Moon, and are launching a counterattack to retake their homeworld via android fighters like 2B.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>While that serves as a general premise for the story of Nier, or at least this entry, in particular, the secrets players unravel through the course of the narrative essentially turn this trope-filled post-apocalyptic story into one of the most compelling and profound studies on humanity and its existential dread, a story that has already been adapted for different mediums numerous times in the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/nier-automata-wgtc.jpg><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=false>Aniplex is the parent company of acclaimed studios CloverWorks (Wonder Egg Priority) and A-1 Pictures (Sword Art Online), among many more, as well as the owner of streaming platforms Funimation and Crunchyroll. The company and its subsidiaries license and distribute popular shows around the world including Fullmetal Alchemist and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. That in itself fuels our hype for the upcoming Nier: Automata series, though whether this is an adaptation of the events seen in the game or a sequel set in the same timeline remains to be seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvtcSrZJqtpKS6osDAZpinoZ2aerSx0aKcrGWZqHqwssWimqKZnKHGbrXNZquhnV2svLO30madq6edYq6vtc%2BlnLFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-galway-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>James Galway Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
