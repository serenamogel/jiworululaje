He was surrounded by his family. On December 1, 1943, Rudolph Booth was born in Blue Mountain, Mississippi, to his proud parents, Wilbo and Junie Bell (Rutherford) Booth. Rudolph Booth was named after his father. Peoria, Illinois, was Rudolph’s destination when he was an adult.</p><p>He worked at Caterpillar for close to thirty-five years. He was committed to the task that he did. Following his retirement, he continued to work in the hotel sector, most recently performing his duties at the Embassy Suites and the Visitors Bureau. Over the course of his longtime membership at St. Paul Baptist Church, Rudolph served as the church’s head usher, van ministry leader, and leader of the Men’s Group. Rudolph was never confronted by an unknown individuals. The quality of hospitality was innate in him, and he frequently greeted guests with a warm embrace and a broad smile.</p><p>When it came to Manual Basketball, he was a die-hard fan who never missed a single game. Over the course of his bowling career, Rudolph has been a member of a number of different leagues. Rudolph eventually tied the knot with Yvonne Stenson, the woman he had loved his entire life, and on November 17, 2019, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. She is successful. He is also survived by his children, David Booth and his wife Melissa, who reside in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><p>Derrick Booth and his wife Jehan, who reside in Peoria, Illinois; Daniel Booth and his wife Ashley, who reside in Carbondale, Illinois; Devon Booth and his wife Tony, who reside in Peoria, Illinois; and Alicia Posey and her husband Richard, who reside in Snellville, Georgia; eight grandchildren, Mariah, Sydney, Brandon, Chancellor, Jianna, Jaxon, DeLaney, and Aden; and his cherished furry companion, Koby. All of his relatives, including his parents, his twin sister Ruchelle Booth Hill, his brother James Booth, and his grandson Derrick “DJ” Booth Jr., passed away before him.</p><p>The visitation will begin at nine in the morning and continue for two hours before the funeral ceremony, which will be held privately at Victory Christian Church on Saturday, July 25, 2020, at eleven in the morning. The Reverend Deveraux Hubbard, Senior Pastor of St. Paul Baptist Church, will offer words of comfort, while Pastor Charles Brown will act as the host for the event. The historical mausoleum in Springdale will be the location where Rudolph will be laid to rest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKqlmcZurs6oq6Fln5e2tcHAq7Bmm5%2Brtq%2Bz06ilZqSRYrGmrdOhZJqmlGKztrrEq5ilZaaewKrAwK2gqKZdmbK1rcilqmaglaeycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kayla-cardonas-ethnicity-is-she-filipino-meet-the-cast-of-netflixs-selling-the-oc-399561-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kayla Cardonas Ethnicity Is She Filipino?
