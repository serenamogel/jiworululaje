After graduating from the Professional Performance Arts School, she signed a deal with Clive Davis, the head of Arista Records. Davis left Arista to start J Records and Keys followed. Her debut album, Songs in A Minor (2001), went platinum five times over and earned her five Grammys. She followed up with hit albums such as The Diary of Alicia Keys (2003), As I Am (2007) and Girl on Fire (2009), all of which won the artist Grammys.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Musician and actor Alicia Keys was born Alicia Augello Cook on January 25, 1981, in New York, New York. Growing up, Keys was raised by her mother, Nikki Augello—a part-time actress and paralegal. She began piano lessons at age 7 and Augello's dogged insistence that her daughter stick with the instrument led Keys to attend Manhattan's prestigious Professional Performance Arts School, where she majored in choir. Having excelled academically, Keys was allowed to graduate at the age of 16.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Keys had already attracted the attention of record company executives while in high school, and after what amounted to a bidding war for her talents, she signed with Arista Records in 1998. While she was accepted to Columbia University on a full scholarship, after a four-week stint at the school, Keys departed to devote herself fully to her music.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Albums and Songs</h2><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Songs in A Minor'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1999, Clive Davis—head of Arista Records—left the prominent record company where he worked to start J Records. Keys decided to follow Davis, who had engineered the careers of soul luminaries such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/aretha-franklin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Aretha Franklin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Aretha Franklin</a>, to his new label. Unlike many of her pop-music contemporaries, the precocious Keys not only sings, but writes and produces her own music. At J Records, Keys found the freedom to complete her debut effort, which included material she had started work on years prior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Davis carefully orchestrated a media blitz before the release of the album, including an appearance on Oprah the day before the album hit shelves. When it was finally released, Keys' debut album, Songs in A Minor (2001), went platinum five times over.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Critics roundly praised the album not only for its musical polish, but also for its lyric maturity. At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Keys took home awards for Song of the Year, Best R&B Song, Best R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best New Artist.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Diary of Alicia Keys'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Keys released her second album, The Diary of Alicia Keys, in 2003. She proved that her success as a new artist two years prior wasn't a fluke, with the album debuting at No. 1. Keys also took home several Grammys for her sophomore album, including Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, Best R&B Song, Best R&B Album and Best R&B Performance by a Group or Duo with Vocals for her duet with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/usher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Usher class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Usher</a> on the song "My Boo."</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'As I Am,' 'Empire State of Mind'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Keys' seemingly unstoppable career continued in 2007 with the release of As I Am. The album also debuted at No. 1, selling more than 740,000 copies in its first week, and went on to garner her two more Grammys.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was during this time that Keys also began to collaborate with more artists. In 2008, she recorded "Another Way to Die" with Jack White, which was featured as the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace (2008). She also recorded the hit single "Empire State of Mind" with fellow New Yorker <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/jay-z data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Jay-Z class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jay-Z</a> the following year.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Element of Freedom,' 'Girl on Fire'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the end of 2009, Keys released her fourth studio album, The Element of Freedom. Although the album didn't fare nearly as well as her previous albums—it debuted at No. 2 with the lead single "Doesn't Mean Anything" and reached No. 60 on the Billboard Hot 200—the album did become Keys' first to hit No. 1 in the United Kingdom. Her fifth studio album, Girl on Fire (2012), put Keys back at her top spot, debuting at No. 1. She won the Grammy for Best R&B Album in 2014 for her work.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Here'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Keys followed in 2016 with her sixth studio effort, Here. The album, which featured the singles "In Common" and "Blended Family (What You Do for Love)," topped out at No. 2 on the Hot 200 and reached No. 1 on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Film and TV Projects</h2><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Smokin' Aces,' 'The Secret Life of Bees'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1985, a 4-year-old Keys appeared as one of Keshia Knight Pulliam's friends on The Cosby Show. She appeared on several other series years later, including Charmed, American Dreams and The Backyardigans. Keys made her big screen debut in 2006, appearing in the action film Smokin' Aces as Georgia Sykes.
