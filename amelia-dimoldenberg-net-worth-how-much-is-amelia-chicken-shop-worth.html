Her father is Paul Dimoldenberg, a Labour Party councilor in Westminster. She completed A-levels in English, art, politics, and information technology before graduating from Central Saint Martins in London with a Foundation Diploma in Art and Design and a BA in Fashion Communication. “I was always on the outskirts of the ultra-fashionable scene and left the party-going to those who had the stamina, and the invite,” she writes of her university days.</p><p>Chicken Shop Date began as a humorous column written by Dimoldenberg for the youth magazine The Cut, which was based at the Stowe Centre, a youth club on Harrow Road in London. It was other members’ interest in grime that led her to interview grime artists, as she “wanted to know more about the music”; she began by interviewing “friends of friends”. Dimoldenberg had the idea to frame the interviews as dates, and the location of a chicken shop was chosen as it was “somewhere you wouldn’t usually go on a date”. The first filmed episode was released in 2014, and it featured a “date” with grime MC Ghetts.</p><h2>Amelia Dimoldenberg Net Worth: How much is Amelia Chicken Shop worth?</h2><p>Amelia’s net worth is estimated to be $800,000, which is roughly £605,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmdmrmqrYydoKannJmyr67Eq55mppWperi70a2fZqCfrHquwcKhZKKrXZa6prjImmScoJmYuKa6jKyfqKhdrLyzwMdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristin-cavallari-boyfriend-5162540.html><span>←</span><span>All of the Reality Stars Past Romances Hollywood Life</span></a>
