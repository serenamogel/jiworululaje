He was then able to resume his normal life and toured with Van Halen twice more. However, <a href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that the rock star had been secretly flying back and forth between Germany and the United States for treatment for about five years prior to his death. <a href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;also reported&nbsp;Eddie was hospitalized in November 2019 due to "intestinal issues and abdominal pain" caused by a poor reaction to his cancer medications.</p><p>While fans longed for another Van Halen reunion, original lead singer David Lee Roth was not too optimistic about the thought, following rumors of Eddie's declining health. "I don't know that Eddie is ever really going to rally for the rigors of the road again," he told the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a> in the summer of 2020.</p><p>Ironically enough, Eddie told <a href=#>Billboard</a> that his passion may have also been his downfall. "I used metal picks — they're brass and copper — which I always held in my mouth, in the exact place where I got the tongue cancer," he explained in 2015. "Plus, I basically live in a recording studio that's filled with electromagnetic energy."&nbsp;</p><p>While his passing is tragic, it seems that Eddie Van Halen lived a life he loved and was surrounded by those who loved him until the end.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, please contact <a href=#>SAMHSA</a>'s 24-hour National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21nbIJye8inqqKclWKypbDInmSvmZ5itaK4xKeqZqqfmLhuv9OaqWakmZuycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ganglands-season-2-on-netflix-all-you-need-to-know-about-exceptional-cast-of-french-crime-thriller.html><span>←</span><span>'Ganglands' Season 2 on Netflix: All you need to know about exceptional cast of French crime-thrille</span></a>
