Afterwards, Alder offered a few words of advice, with this experience in turn inspiring Trip to work hard and train to become a Champion. As such, Trip grew up idolizing Alder and held him in high regard.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_the_Series:_Black_.26_White></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_the_Series:_Black_&_White><i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Black & White">Pokémon the Series: Black & White</a></i></span></h4><p>Trip debuted in <i><a href=# title=BW001>In The Shadow of Zekrom!</a></i> as a beginning Trainer ready to choose his <a href=# title="First partner Pokémon">first partner Pokémon</a>. After meeting with <a href=# title="Professor Juniper">Professor Juniper</a>, he chose <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Trip's Snivy">Snivy</a> as his new partner. He took a dislike to <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> after learning he was from Kanto, a region Trip did not think very highly of. On his way out of the lab, he challenged Ash to a Pokémon battle. He had much interest in battling <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, a species that is foreign in his region. Because Pikachu could not use any <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric-type</a> moves at the time, it was easily defeated by the Snivy. Trip left Nuvema Town to begin his journey, rudely telling Ash to go back to the basics.</p><p>Trip was revealed by <a href=# title="Cilan (anime)">Cilan</a> that prior to <i><a href=# title=BW005>Triple Leaders, Team Threats!</a></i> to have evolved his Snivy into <a href=# title="Servine (Pokémon)">Servine</a> and earned the <a href=# title=Badge>Trio Badge</a>.</p><p>Trip appeared again at the <a href=# title="Luxuria Town">Luxuria Town</a> <a href=# title="Battle Club">Battle Club</a> in <i><a href=# title=BW010>A Rival Battle for Club Champ!</a></i>, where he and Ash had a five-on-five battle, although Trip initially offered to have a <a href=# title="Full Battle">Full Battle</a> with Ash. His Tranquill defeated <a href=# title="Ash's Oshawott">Ash's Oshawott</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Tepig">Tepig</a> in just two hits with its <a href=# title="Super Luck (Ability)">Super Luck</a>-boosted <a href=# title="Aerial Ace (move)">Aerial Ace</a>, but lost to Ash's Pikachu. Pikachu was defeated by <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Trip's Servine">Servine</a> again. <a href=# title="Ash's Snivy">Snivy</a> defeated Trip's Servine by using <a href=# title="Attract (move)">Attract</a>.

Afterwards, Trip called Pikachu and Snivy "okay", but said that the rest of Ash's <a href=# title=Party>team</a> was a joke, and so was their Trainer. Trip then condescendingly departing from the Battle Club.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/48/Trip_anime.png/375px-Trip_anime.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Trip's appearance in the anime<p>In <i><a href=# title=BW022>A Venipede Stampede!</a></i>, Trip was training in <a href=# title="Castelia City">Castelia City</a> when a swarm of <a href=# title="Venipede (Pokémon)">Venipede</a> suddenly attacked. He used his <a href=# title="Lampent (Pokémon)">Lampent</a> to try to fight them off, but Ash yelled at him for doing so, saying that he was only making things worse. Trip insulted him, but was interrupted by <a href=# title=Burgh>Burgh</a>, who agreed with Ash. Later, Trip would continue his pursuit and went after the leader of the Venipede swarm, in spite of Burgh's words, and ordered Lampent to hit it with <a href=# title="Shadow Ball (move)">Shadow Ball</a>, but Ash blocked the attack. Again, Burgh told Trip that he was going about it the wrong way, resulting in Trip stopping. Trip then used Tranquill to help coax out the remaining Venipede and lead them safely out of the city. That night he opted to head to the following city to participate in his next Gym battle rather than waiting for the Castelia Gym to be restored.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=BW031>Ash and Trip's Third Battle!</a></i>, Trip, along with his <a href=# title="Vanillite (Pokémon)">Vanillite</a> and <a href=# title="Timburr (Pokémon)">Timburr</a>, battled Ash once more. During their battle, Trip revealed to Ash the reason behind Oshawott's inability to use Aqua Jet and even told him about the Unova League Champion Alder. Their battle ended in a tie after Servine defeated Snivy, Vanillite tied with Tepig, and Oshawott defeated Timburr.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=BW039>Reunion Battles In Nimbasa!</a></i>, Trip entered the <a href=# title="Club Battle">Club Battle</a>, a tournament held by <a href=# title="Nimbasa Town">Nimbasa Town</a>'s <a href=# title="Don George">Don George</a>. He was chosen to battle Cilan in the first match up. In the <a href=# title=BW040>next episode</a>, he used his <a href=# title="Gurdurr (Pokémon)">Gurdurr</a> to battle against <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Cilan's Dwebble">Cilan's Dwebble</a>. During the battle Trip put Gurdurr's physical strength along with its girder to great use, giving him an early lead in the battle. Despite putting up a good fight, however, Gurdurr was defeated and Trip was knocked out of the competition. After his Pokémon healed at the <a href=# title="Pokémon Center">Pokémon Center</a> that night, he left Nimbasa Town believing that there was no point to staying there any longer.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/7c/Ash_Trip.png/375px-Ash_Trip.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Trip and Ash<p>In <i><a href=# title=BW052>Ash Versus the Champion!</a></i>, Trip revealed he had already obtained five <a href=# title=Gym>Gym</a> <a href=# title=Badge>Badges</a>. During that time, he also got to reunite with <a href=# title=Alder>Alder</a>, who could not remember him. Seeing how much Alder loafed about while battling Ash, Trip's opinion of him slightly changed. He vowed not only to defeat him but also promised to follow the path he believed in before angrily departing.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=BW070>The Clubsplosion Begins!</a></i>, Trip registered himself to compete in the <a href=# title=Clubsplosion>Clubsplosion</a>. He planned to compete with his newly-evolved <a href=# title="Conkeldurr (Pokémon)">Conkeldurr</a> and his opponent in the first round was revealed to be <a href=# title="Bianca (anime)">Bianca</a>, who he considered to be just practice. He then battled her and her <a href=# title="Bianca's Emboar">Emboar</a> in <i><a href=# title=BW071>Search for the Clubultimate!</a></i>. Though he and Conkeldurr put up a strong fight, he lost to her in <a href=# title=BW072>the next episode</a>. Like he did after his loss in the Club Battle, he left <a href=# title="Ambiga Town">Ambiga Town</a> that night rather than staying and watching the rest of the tournament.</p><p>Trip appeared again in <i><a href=# title=BW090>Jostling for the Junior Cup!</a></i> in order to participate in the <a href=# title="Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup">Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup</a>. His goal was to win and get the chance to battle Alder. His first round battle was with <a href=# title=Burgundy>Burgundy</a>. Using his <a href=# title="Trip's Serperior">Serperior</a>, which had evolved from Servine, he was able to defeat her quickly by utilizing a combination of Leer and Solar Beam and advanced to the second round. In <i><a href=# title=BW091>Battling Authority Once Again!</a></i>, Trip advanced to the semi-finals, where he once again battled Cilan. This time, however, he and Serperior managed to defeat <a href=# title="Cilan's Crustle">Cilan's Crustle</a> with a <a href=# title="Frenzy Plant (move)">Frenzy Plant</a>, qualifying them for the final match against Ash. In <i><a href=# title=BW092>Ash, Iris, and Trip: Then There Were Three!</a></i>, Trip battled Ash in the finals, using his Serperior against Ash's Pignite. Despite the type advantage and Ash's strategy to boost his own speed with Flame Charge, Serperior maintained the speed advantage. This allowed it to make quick work of Pignite, swiftly defeating it with a powerful Frenzy Plant, winning Trip the tournament in the process. In <i><a href=# title=BW093>Goodbye, Junior Cup - Hello Adventure!</a></i>, Trip battled Alder and his Bouffalant with his Serperior in the prize match, but despite his strategy to lower Bouffalant's guard while also attacking its weak spot, they were defeated in a single hit. After the battle, he was given a speech by Alder about deciding his own path with his Pokémon, and promised to battle him again when the time came. Afterwards, Trip would meet up with Ash and his friends following the tournament. After a brief conversation, he and Ash promised to meet with one another at Unova's <a href=# title="Pokémon League Conference">League Conference</a>. As Trip left, <a href=# title="Iris (anime)">Iris</a> noticed that he had greatly subdued his nasty attitude, having been humbled by his battle with Alder.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=BW103>Curtain Up, Unova League!</a></i> and <i><a href=# title=BW104>Mission: Defeat Your Rival!</a></i>, Trip traveled to <a href=# title="Vertress City">Vertress City</a> to compete in the <a href=# title="Vertress Conference">Vertress Conference</a> and met up with Ash and Ash's other rivals in <a href=# title=Unova>Unova</a>. During the match-up process, it was revealed he would battle Ash in the first round of the competition. However, here, he was not arrogant as in past meetings and instead showed a genuine interest in battling with Ash once more. Trip used his Serperior against Ash's Pikachu, at first Pikachu unleashed a barrage of its attacks with Serperior simply avoiding every one of them with relative ease. In retaliation Serperior would unleash a devastating Dragon Tail before following with a barrage of its own techniques culminating in a Wrap attack, cornering Ash and Pikachu. But in spite of these efforts Pikachu managed to defeat Serperior, much to Trip's astonishment and disbelief, with a combination of its Electro Ball and Iron Tail, eliminating Trip from the Conference. After the battle, Trip would have one last conversation with Ash, before they ended their rivalry and became friends. Following this, Trip then left the Vertress Conference to continue his <a href=# title="Pokémon journey">journey</a>.</p><p>He appeared briefly in <i><a href=# title=BW108>A Unova League Evolution!</a></i> in Ash's flashback about his travels in <a href=# title=Unova>Unova</a>.</p><p>Trip made cameo appearances in the ending <a href=# title="Let's Join Hands">Let's Join Hands</a> and in the ending credits of <i><a href=# title=M16>Genesect and the Legend Awakened</a></i>.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/5/55/Unova_Rivals.png/375px-Unova_Rivals.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Journeys:_The_Series></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Journeys:_The_Series><i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=JN117>The Fiery Road to Mastership!</a></i>, Trip was shown watching Iris's <a href=# title="Masters Eight Tournament">Masters Eight Tournament</a> match against <a href=# title="Cynthia (anime)">Cynthia</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Character>Character</span></h3><p>Trip is a reserved individual who tends to keep his feelings to himself. He expressed his emotions much like Ash used to do when he first left his <a href=# title=Hometown>hometown</a>. His strategy is all about planning ahead and completing the basics of <a href=# title="Pokémon training">Pokémon training</a>. Compared to the other rivals of the Unova region, Trip is rather distant and prefers not to interact with them outside of battle. He has a teal-colored <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:digital camera">digital camera</a>, with which he takes <a href=# title=Photography>photos</a> for illustrating his <a href=# title="Pokémon journey">journey</a>. He also has a <a href=# title=Xtransceiver>Xtransceiver</a> so that he can keep in touch with <a href=# title="Battle Club">Battle Clubs</a>. However, much like Ash, Trip tends to get annoyed with those who insult him, as when <a href=# title="Iris (anime)">Iris</a> called him a "little kid" by refusing to battle Ash, along with Cilan's desire to watch them battle, Trip finally accepted Ash's challenge, but was clearly annoyed with the circumstances.</p><p>Trip tends to think very little of the <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a> <a href=# title=Region>region</a>—which he refers to as "the <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Boondocks>boonies</a>"—and anyone from there. He thinks of Ash as a <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:hillbilly>hillbilly</a> who needs to go back to the basics of Pokémon training. However, he will help him out once in a while, as seen when he informed Ash that <a href=# title="Ash's Oshawott">Oshawott</a>'s <a href=# title="Aqua Jet (move)">Aqua Jet</a> was uncontrollable because Oshawott had his eyes closed, and again when he pointed out <a href=# title="Ash's Scraggy">Scraggy</a>'s lack of master over its newly-learned <a href=# title="Focus Blast (move)">Focus Blast</a>. Despite his apparent apathy towards Ash and his generally low opinion on him as a Trainer, Trip tends to be quite attentive towards Ash's battles.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/01/Trip_Camera.png/375px-Trip_Camera.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Trip's camera<p>Despite having just started out as a Trainer, Trip already implements many strategies in his battling. He has defeated Ash in all but two of their battles (the former which they tied, and the latter in which Ash won), despite Ash being a much more experienced Trainer. However, he is less forgiving than Ash and takes losses harder. An instance of this is, when he lost to Cilan, he took a photo of Cilan and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Cilan's Dwebble">Dwebble</a>. When Cilan asked him why he was doing that, Trip replied that he was recording this moment so that he would remember his frustration. Trip also actively insults and is at most as mature as Ash, as shown during his childish banter with Ash during their third battle, along with when he elbowed Ash for Alder's attention.</p><p>As a result of meeting Alder as a child and the promise he was given by him, Trip viewed strength as the most important thing to accomplishing his goals. As such, he deemed any activities that wouldn't increase his strength as unnecessary as seen when he left after his losses in the Club Battle and the Clubsplosion, also when he refused to battle Ash on multiple occasions. After his reunion with Alder and his disappointment at Alder's aloofness, Trip began to seek out his own path to beating Alder and becoming Champion. During the Junior Cup, Trip had shown a heightened amount of confidence in his own abilities to the point of arrogance, believing he could defeat both Alder and <a href=# title="Cynthia (anime)">Cynthia</a>. However, after losing to Alder, he began to realize the error in his views, and as such, he had a change in his attitude. This can be seen in <i><a href=# title=BW103>Curtain Up, Unova League!</a></i>, when he greets Ash and his friends with a more friendly approach than before, with his change in attitude being noticed by the other characters such as Cilan and Iris. Along with his newer persona, he showed a genuine interest in battling Ash, and along with that ceased his past tendencies of mocking him. Despite his change in attitude, he still maintains his distance and prefers not to interact with the other rivals.</p><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h3><p>This listing is of Trip's known <a href=# title="Pokémon (species)">Pokémon</a> in the <a href=# title="Pokémon anime">anime</a>:</p><table align=left width=100%><tbody readability=9.8914996544575><tr readability=2><td colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=25% align=center><a href=# class=image title="Trip's Timburr"><img alt="Trip's Timburr" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/20/Trip_Timburr.png/300px-Trip_Timburr.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=# class=image title="Trip's Conkeldurr"><img alt="Trip's Conkeldurr" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/5/53/Trip_Conkeldurr.png/300px-Trip_Conkeldurr.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p></td><td><b>Timburr → Gurdurr → <span id=Conkeldurr></span>Conkeldurr</b></td></tr><tr readability=25.660883280757><td rowspan=5 align=left width=75% readability=22.55047318612><a href=# title="Conkeldurr (Pokémon)">Conkeldurr</a> is the sixth Pokémon that Trip was revealed to have.
