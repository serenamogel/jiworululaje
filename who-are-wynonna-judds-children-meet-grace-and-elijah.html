Meet Grace and Elijah</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Despite not being as famous as their mother, Wynonna Judd’s children <strong>are still prominent figures in the industry, albeit for different reasons.</strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Even though she is one of the most talented and successful country musicians, Wynonna Judd’s personal life is a bit of a rollercoaster. From getting married three times in a row to becoming a mother and watching her daughter get in several troubles, Wynonna has undoubtedly experienced a lot.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Wynonna’s motherhood journey began in 1993 when she met Nashville businessman Arch Kelley III. A year later, the couple’s relationship evolved into something more serious when they became parents to their son Elijah. Despite growing up in a conservative community, Wynonna gave birth outside wedlock. Finally, however, Wynonna and Arch tied the knot in 1996. Unfortunately, their marriage lasted until 1999, when they filed for divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>Five years after her Kelley heartbreak, Wynonna found love again. This time the country musician hooked up with her long-term bodyguard D.R. Roach. <a href=#>The couple exchanged marital vows on November 22, 2003</a>. However, four years into that relationship, chaos struck when police arrested Roach on suspicion of sexually assaulting a child. On the fifth day after the arrest, Wynonna filed for divorce and shifted her attention solely to caring for herself and her children and fostering their mental growth.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wynonnas_Third_Marriage_To_Cactus_Moser></span><strong>Wynonna’s Third Marriage To Cactus Moser</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/cb/7e/e7/cb7ee762051e3b575a6777192ef02ef7.jpg><p>Although it was difficult for Wynonna to trust again after two failed marriages, the musician grew strong during the preceding years. She also seemed to benefit from the separation by rebuilding herself into a strong, fully self-aware person.&nbsp;</p><p>After taking an extended break from this chain, she decided to give love another chance again, and luckily for her; she met that special one everyone hopes to have in their lives. Surprisingly, only their respective children were present when Wynonna Judd married Highway 101 drummer Cactus Moser in June 2012. Wynonna didn’t invite her mother or sister to the wedding to keep things straightforward and meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>Her wedding to Cactus was exclusively about the leading group and the start of their new life together as a family. The couple has experienced a lot together, including a terrible fatal bike accident that led to the amputation of his leg. However, ever since that incident, the two remain inseparable as they continue growing stronger together and embracing each day as it comes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wynonna_Judd_Has_Two_Children></span><strong>Wynonna Judd Has Two Children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-pinterest wp-block-embed-pinterest"></figure><p>Wynonna Judd is a mother to two children, a son and a daughter, respectively named Elijah Judd and Grace Pauline Kelley. The musician gave birth to both of her children during her marriage to first husband, Arch Kelley III. The oldest, <a href=#>Elijah, was born in 1994</a> before she got married. Meanwhile, Grace was born after her marriage to Arch.&nbsp;</p><p>Like his mother and maternal grandmother, Naomi Judd, Elijah decided to pursue a career as a musician in the entertainment industry. He has reportedly worked with his mother and is trying to establish a name for himself in the cutthroat field. However, unlike her brother, Grace is a notorious troublemaker.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wynonnas_Daughter_Is_Famous_for_Getting_in_Trouble_With_the_Law></span><strong>Wynonna’s Daughter Is Famous for Getting in Trouble With the Law</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Although Wynonna’s second child, Grace, is the most popular of her two children, unfortunately, it is for the wrong reasons. Grace’s frequent appearance in the media started when she was a teenager. At first, it began with her tense relationship with her mother, but as time passed, it became about her run-ins with the law.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, Police arrested <a href=#>Grace in Williamson County</a> for manufacturing, delivery, possession, and intent to sell meth. She was found guilty and imprisoned for a time, with fines totaling over $3,000 paid. After her release in 2017, the court ordered her to participate in a drug treatment program. Still, she repeatedly violated this provision of her probation and that eventually landed her an eight years prison sentence.</p><p>However, recently updated jail records revealed that Grace’s case is treated under parole for supervision. The document also shows that Grace must report to the parole office P94F every two weeks until her sentence expires on September 22, 2024. The Sun revealed Grace’s parole mugshots in February and remarked that Grace appeared healthy and alert in the picture. Compared to her previous images from drug-related arrests,</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wynonna_Talked_About_Her_Daughters_Addiction_to_Meth></span><strong>Wynonna Talked About Her Daughter’s Addiction to Meth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/9b/a8/f9/9ba8f9e21d40c2d1f2f64629fca9fac5.jpg><p>The Judd family has experienced some significant upheaval in the past, proving that drama isn’t limited to Grace alone. In actuality, Wynonna herself had a tumultuous relationship with her mother and <a href=#>her sister Ashley</a> <a href=#>noting</a>:</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2.5><p><strong>“I will tell you this. My daughter is the strongest Judd woman in our herstory, She’s healthier than I was at 23. How she got there – I would not go that way, but I was also sequestered.”&nbsp;</strong></p></figure><p>Wynonna made this statement during a private interview with John Rich in which she also discussed her daughter’s legal problems, her personal life, and her musical career. She added that the fact that she rode the tour bus with her mother and musical partner, Naomi Judd, helped to keep her out of trouble, and admitted that, had she not had music, the music star would have been the one standing in her daughter’s shoes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jJqpnmWnrruwus2aZKOtlJnAbq%2FHoqOdqpWjeq6xxK1koKqRmLJurc2dZJ6kmZ%2BuqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-lockett-and-wife-to-be-lauren-jackson-age-difference-as-couple-is-engaged-416672-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler Lockett and Wife To Be Lauren Jackson Age Difference As Couple Is Engaged</span></a>
