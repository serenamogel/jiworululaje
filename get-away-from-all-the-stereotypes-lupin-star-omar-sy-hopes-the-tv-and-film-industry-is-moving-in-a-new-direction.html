He’s also experienced varying degrees of success in the U.S. with roles in the “Jurassic Park” franchise and “X-Men: Days of Future Past.” But with “Lupin” things are different.&nbsp;</p><p>“Playing Lupin is like an English actor playing James Bond. I was so happy to give it a modern vibe, showing Lupin today and having Lupin be a Black man,” the actor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Essence</a> for a feature story.</p><p>In France, actors of color have been noticeably vocal about feeling invisible in a sea of white creatives.&nbsp;</p><p>“Once upon a time, until around the 1960s, many high-profile Black Americans, intellectuals, writers and musicians found refuge in Paris to escape segregation,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">explained&nbsp;Régis Dubois</a>, author of “Black People in French Cinema.”&nbsp;He continued, “But since then, a lot has changed, and it’s the other way around.”&nbsp;</p><p>But for Sy, the experience may be slightly different in that he has found his stride both at home and abroad.</p><p>“I think I’m more hired in U.S. as a French actor than a Black man,” he shared. Still, depicting a character who is written as a white man in French literature gives Sy hope that the tides are in fact turning, and Black actors are beginning to see roles that shape a different narrative.&nbsp;</p><p>“I hope that it’s going to be the first, but not the last,” he said. “Maybe it’s going to help people to grow their [audiences’] imagination. There are a lot of stories that you can tell with Black men and get away from all the stereotypes and tell different stories.”</p><p>Comedian and actor Kevin Hart shares a similar sentiment. When discussing his latest film, “Fatherhood,” Hart said presenting a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black father in a good light </a>was important.</p><p><br>“I love the opportunity of being a Black father on-screen in a positive light,” said Hart while appearing on “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunday TODAY</a>.”&nbsp;“Most of the times they’re on drugs, off drugs, in jail, out of jail. To have some sort of positivity behind it and maybe being a part of changing the stereotype.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49vZmpuX5yytXnAsJiyZZanvK55wKWjZqyYmnq0wMSrnKisqaWytHnLrqeipl2owaK%2BjKikmqpdqMZutM6pnKxlpJ2ybsDVZpinnF2btq25jKKlna2jqb%2B6ecisZKanpp67qHnIp2SaZZ6axG6wyKucnKyZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drew-timme-parents-height.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Father Matt And Mother Megan Timme?
