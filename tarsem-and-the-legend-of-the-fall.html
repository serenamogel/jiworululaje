All I had to do was choose my angle so I could use their shapes without showing their surroundings. I thought, I can make a labyrinth out of this if I make it look like it’s enclosed. The fact is, it's a really cheap-looking park in the middle of Jaidpur."</p><p>And as for the Blue City...</p><p>"Jodhpur, the blue city, is a Brahmin city where you’re only supposed to paint your house blue. I made a contract with the city; we would give them free paint. We knew legally they could only choose blue. So they painted their houses blue and it looked more vibrant than it ever had before."</p><p>Tarsem made it all sound so simple, and when you see the film it all seems literally impossible.</p><p>"There are no computer effects. It’s just the kind of visual stuff like what I was doing all the time with commercials, where it looks like more than it is. In all these places I had filmed over at least 17 years, I told the people, this is a paid job, its a commercial, but I’ll come back one day and make this place look magical. To use a line from 'The Godfather,' he does them a favor, and one day, 'and that day may never come,' there will be a favor in return. And 17 years later that day came, I showed up, and some of the favors I could cash in, and some I couldn't. "</p><p>And then Tarsem made one of the most astonishing films I have ever seen. It is all the more special in this age of computer-generated special effects, because we see things that cannot exist, but our eyes do not lie, and they do exist, yes, they really do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmoqakmr%2B3tcSwqmiskafAprmMmqWdZaSdsm64xKCcp5xdpLNuwMeeZJ%2BZnKE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./step-brothers-2008.html><span>←</span><span>Step Brothers movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)</span></a>
