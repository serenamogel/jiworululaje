The married couple met each other in Australia back in 2002 during a party, and they totally hit it off.</p><p class=Wg>During a conversation with <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com.au/isla-fisher-reveals-her-secret-fantasy>Marie Claire</a>, the Australian actress pointed out that meeting her current husband was like "winning the lottery" and that their relationship works due to their similar sense of humor and willingness to be married.</p><p class=Wg>Two years after their first meeting, Fisher and Cohen got engaged. One aspect of their lives seemed to be an obstacle to the wedding, though: their religion.</p><p class=Wg>Isla Fisher <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://theweek.com/articles/508857/isla-fishers-slow-conversion>was raised Methodist</a>, while the actor is an observant Jew. Shortly after the news of their engagement became public, the actress confessed that <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/i-is-marrying-me-julie-6967254.html>she would do "anything"</a> to be with Cohen, including convert to "any religion."</p><p class=Wg><strong class=Ug>ISLA FISHER CONVERTING TO JUDAISM</strong></p><p class=Wg>Although Fisher didn't share many details about their impending wedding, she pointed out that religion came second to love for them and that she would "definitely" have a Jewish wedding to be with him.</p><p class=Wg>Fast forward to 2009, and the couple had not tied the knot yet. In 2007, though, they welcomed their first child together, Olive.</p><h3 class=ah><strong class=Ug>[Cohen] has been known to show up at home still in character.</strong></h3><p class=Wg>As The Week reported at the time, the reason they were taking so long to get married was that Fisher needed to convert to Judaism to be Cohen's wife. About it, the actress <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://theweek.com/articles/508857/isla-fishers-slow-conversion>said</a>:</p><p class=Wg>"It is always reported that I am still studying, so I am either the slowest studier in the world, or I have, in fact, converted."</p><p class=Wg>It was also reported at the time that the "Wedding Crashers" star had taken on the Hebrew name Ayala and had stopped eating pork and other non-kosher food.</p><p class=Wg>Finally, Isla Fisher officially became Sacha Baron Cohen's wife on March 15, 2010. The <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/isla-fisher-and-sacha-baron-cohens-secret-six-guest-wedding/>traditional Jewish ceremony</a> was held in Paris, and only six people attended the nuptials.</p><p class=Wg>Three years after tying the knot, Fisher admitted that she loved many aspects of her new religion, including the focus on <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/387072/Isla-Fisher-smoulders-in-front-of-the-camera-as-she-admits-she-loves-being-Jewish>family, food, and "laughter.</a>" The actress also said that studying theology was "fascinating."</p><p class=Wg><strong class=Ug>ISLA FISHER SHIELDS HER KIDS FROM WORK</strong></p><p class=Wg>Throughout the years, Cohen and Fisher have had a relatively private relationship. During her interview with <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com.au/isla-fisher-reveals-her-secret-fantasy>Marie Claire</a>, though, the actress admitted that she tries to shield her three children (apart from Olive, the couple has a daughter name Elula and a son named Montgomery) from her work.</p><p class=Wg>Cohen, on the other hand, is not as strict in this aspect as he has been known to show up at home still in character as Borat Sagdiyev or Ali G, two of his most famous personas.</p><p class=Wg>Fisher prefers to expose her kids only to the "fun parts," including picking a pretty dress or getting her hair and makeup done. Her strategy has worked fairly well, especially considering that she and her husband celebrated <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7769003/Isla-Fisher-celebrates-18-year-romance-husband-Sacha-Baron-Cohen.html>18 years together</a> in December 2019.</p><p class=Wg>To commemorate the milestone, Isla Fisher shared a post on social media revealing the secret behind her and <a class="ae -U" href=#>Cohen's</a> lasting relationship: "it's all in the synchronized snacking technique."
