In particular, revamps of the beloved titles from the so-called Disney Renaissance (1989-99) have gone down well with audiences and as such, it’s no surprise that the latest movie that we’re hearing will get the remake treatment is 1999’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tarzan</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=599 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>Yesterday, we brought you the news that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds is on the studio’s wishlist</a> to play the titular jungle man and our sources have now informed us that Chris Pratt is likewise on Disney’s radar to bring Tarzan to life. As the project is at such an early stage, though, it’s possible – and probably likely – that the studio hasn’t reached out to either actor yet as they’re only on a wishlist right now. As such, don’t be surprised if Pratt denies this. In fact, we imagine that he’s completely unaware that the Mouse House is even eyeing him.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>That being said, we’re inclined to believe what we’re hearing, as this is the same source who told us last month that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney was working on&nbsp;Aladdin 2</a>, something that was just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officially confirmed this past week</a>. We’ve also brought you the news that remakes of other Disney movies released around this time – the late 90s/early 00s – are in the works, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hercules</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Treasure Planet</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlantis: The Lost Empire</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tarzan-and-jane-670x349.jpeg alt=tarzan width=640 height=333 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>Going by the fact that Disney is looking at both Pratt and Reynolds for Tarzan, we can maybe glean something about the direction the project will go in. Both actors are known for their comedic chops whereas the original animated character – voiced by Tony Goldwyn – is more of a straight-laced, brooding hero. Perhaps Disney want the remake to dig into the potential slapstick or light-hearted antics that you can get from an uncivilized man raised by apes, much like the Brendan Fraser-starring George of the Jungle&nbsp;did back in the 90s.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>In any case, while we wait to hear more about the <strong>Tarzan</strong>&nbsp;redo, the next theatrical live-action remake on the way from the studio is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mulan</a>, coming March 27th, 2020. Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady and the Tramp</a>&nbsp;is also due on Disney Plus in November.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGqmah6sb7Aratmq6SWv264yK%2BcmpuknryvedOaqbOZnmK%2FprnApJxmnJmou6bFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brenda-blethyn.html><span>←</span><span>Brenda Blethyn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
