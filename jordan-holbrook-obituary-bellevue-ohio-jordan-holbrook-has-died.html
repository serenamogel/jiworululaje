He passed away on May 8, 2021, at the age of 73, and he is now resting in heaven. His passing occurred on that date. Both Carolyn’s father and her husband have passed away: Carolyn’s father, Troy H. Jordan, in 1993, and her husband, Gene Holbrook, in 2017. Both of their names are listed on the headstones of their respective cemeteries. Both Carolyn’s mother and father had previously passed away prior to her birth.</p><p>She is survived by her mother, Lily “Orene” Haynie Jordan Ward, as well as two brothers, Robert H. Jordan of Holly Springs and Mike Ward of Hot Springs, Arkansas, and a sister, Mary J. Miller of Atoka, Tennessee. She is also survived by her father, Robert H. Jordan of Holly Springs. In addition, she is survived by her grandchildren, Mary Simmons, Shirley Simmons, Patricia Simmons, and Brandon Jeffries. Patricia Simmons was her daughter.</p><p>Since Carolyn had first began going to the First Baptist Church in Holly Springs, a significant amount of time had passed since she had started going there. She was a member of the Pilot Club of Holly Springs for a significant amount of time and volunteered a significant amount of her time there. Over the course of her membership, she served in a variety of official capacities at the club, including as president, vice president, and secretary. It was a form of outreach for her, and it allowed her to communicate both her faith and her passion for the arts at the same time. She taught ceramics. Because of this, she was able to communicate with a greater number of people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwts6rm5qmXZ28ra7RqKakZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZpqVobmmwtSeZKigmaR6q7vRnZinZZikuaO%2BzqiiZqCRqHqltcSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jane-reilly-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jane Reilly Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
