Dash also ventured into film production, marketing, merchandise, and talent management.</p><p>Despite his successes, Dash has faced several financial issues in recent years. In 2019, he told a New York judge that he was too broke to pay child support, and most of his income was being garnished by various creditors. Dash has also faced legal issues, including being sued for releasing music without permission and being accused of sexual assault, which was mostly cleared by a federal jury in early 2023.</p><p>Dash has had several high-profile relationships, including with R&B singer Aaliyah, whom he planned to marry before her death in 2001. He was also married to Rachel Roy, with whom he had two daughters, leading to a bitter custody battle and accusations of domestic abuse.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCwwKamp2WUlsCpec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-plays-jumpman-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie-and-whats-his-relation-to-mario.html><span>←</span><span>Who plays Jumpman in The Super Mario Bros.
