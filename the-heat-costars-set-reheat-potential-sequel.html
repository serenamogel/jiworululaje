One would think that a film’s star publicly dismissing the idea of a follow-up would kill talk of a sequel, but it would seem that the conversation is not over yet.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Fox and The Heat director Paul Feig have announced plans to develop a sequel focusing on Beth (Jamie Denbo) and Gina (Jamie Chaffin),&nbsp;two foul-mouthed relatives of Det. Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy). The squirm-inducing duo, who turned Mullins’ uncomfortable homecoming into a stand-out scene, were a raunchy delight, as well as a highlight in a film brimming with great supporting performances.</p><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=54 data-injectable=false>On the subject of a Beth and Gina spin-off, Feig said:</p><p>Jamie and Jessica are two of the funniest people on this planet. They took small roles in&nbsp;The Heat&nbsp;and turned them into characters worthy of their own movie. I can’t wait to unleash Beth and Gina on the world. Run for your lives.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Could a stand-alone film centering exclusively upon these two loud-mouthed characters lead to box office gold? Feig and executives at Fox certainly seem to think so.&nbsp;I, for one, would welcome a&nbsp;film featuring these two, but a sequel to The Heat would surely suffer without Bullock’s services.</p><p>Tell us, do you think a sequel to<strong> The Heat</strong> (without the contributions of its main star) is a good idea?
