They also found a gun near his body, but there was no indication that he ever pointed it at Chow or his son.</p><p>Chow was arrested and charged with murder. This was not the first time that Chow had resorted to violence against suspected shoplifters.</p><p>In fact, he had shot at two other people in separate incidents in 2015 and 2018, but he was never charged because his actions were deemed as self-defense.</p><p>In both cases, the shoplifters had assaulted Chow or threatened to shoot him before he fired his weapon. However, in this case, the sheriff said that Chow’s use of lethal force was unjustified.</p><p>You May Also Read: <a href=#>USC Beaufort Associate Professor Brett Borton Obituary Death Cause And Family</a></p><h2>Rick Chow Murdered Victim – Cyrus Carmack-Belton</h2><p>Chow was arrested on Monday and charged with the murder of the boy identified as Cyrus Carmack-Belton.
