Knowing she is immune, Ellie attempts an exercise in futility by infusing her blood with Sam’s wound, but it is already too late. The following morning, Sam succumbs to the cordyceps infection and attacks her. Henry’s knee jerk response is to put his younger brother down before Ellie can be seriously harmed. The reality of what he has just done quickly grips him. In his grief and shock, Henry turns the gun on himself and pulls the trigger.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=205 data-injectable=false>Joel and Ellie bury their companions, and exchanging barely a word, press on towards Wyoming.

The song’s lyrics speak volumes as to what must be going through Joel and Ellie’s minds as they digest the traumatic event they just witnessed. Whether they need to discuss it or whether they treat Henry and Sam like Tess, they never bring them up again.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=false>Agnes Obel, born in 1980 is a Danish singer and songwriter who released her debut album, Philharmonics, in 2010. The song used in the credits is from her sophomore album, Aventine, released in 2013. A few of her other most popular songs include “Riverside” and “Familiar,” but something tells us that the stats on her most-listened songs on Spotify may start skewing towards “Fuel to Fire” over the next week. Just a hunch.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKynnpx6sbjAsqpmoZ5iwamxjKWYrKxdpLNuwdJmnKmho6SxpnmUZpqrnZSewbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gordon-sargent-age.html><span>←</span><span>Gordon Sargent Age, Height, Wiki, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity</span></a>
