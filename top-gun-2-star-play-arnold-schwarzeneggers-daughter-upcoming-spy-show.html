Spy shows are everywhere these days and many of them are so similar as to be interchangeable, but none of them can boast the star of The Terminator, Commando, The Running Man, Total Recall and True Lies in the lead.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/monica-barbaro-top-gun.jpg alt="Monica Barbaro" width=1000 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>There’s still no word on whether the series will be heading to network TV or created exclusively for streaming, but Schwarzenegger’s fictional daughter has now been cast, with rising star Monica Barbaro officially singing on the dotted line. The 30 year-old will make her feature film debut next year as crack pilot Phoenix in Top Gun: Maverick, but she’s been a regular on television for a while now after appearing in episodes of Hawaii Five-O, Chicago P.D. and Stumptown, as well as Netflix’s The Good Cop, which was canceled after one season in 2018.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Barbaro’s performance in the belated Top Gun sequel is reportedly what convinced Santora to approach her for the role, and she’ll now be joining what’ll surely be one of the most hotly-anticipated shows on the horizon based on <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong>‘s presence alone.
