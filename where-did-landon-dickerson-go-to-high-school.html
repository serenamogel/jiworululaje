He attended Viewmont Elementary School in Hickory; to avoid his school being forgotten, he occasionally references it in the media. As a senior in high school, he participated in the Under Armour All-America Game and was selected for the first-team All-State. Dickerson chose Florida State over offers from Virginia Tech, Tennessee, Georgia, and Auburn despite being a four-star recruit entering college.</p><p>Dickerson’s collegiate career began at Florida State. During training camp, he was named the Seminoles’ starting right guard, making him the first true freshman offensive lineman to start a season opener since Jamie Dukes in 1982. He started the first seven games of the season before suffering a knee injury that ended his season. He started the first four games of his sophomore season before being injured and missing the rest of the season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKmx0Z5knaGUYrmiusOopWacmZi4pr7SqKVmn59iwbB5x6KeoWWjmLWwu8to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-urban-legend-of-le-loyon-explained.html><span>←</span><span>The Alternate Ending Of I Am Legend Explained</span></a>
