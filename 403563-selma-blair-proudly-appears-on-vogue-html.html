Blair sported a blonde pixie cut and tied the look together with her cane, something she began using following her multiple sclerosis diagnosis.</p><p class=fh>"I thought my time to ever grace a Vogue cover again was over, but while I was in the business of listening, changing and becoming, the people I admire most dreamed a bit of magic for the cover of @britishvogue," she <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CrQu9IqL1b3>captioned</a> the post in part. In 2018, Blair turned to Instagram to reveal she had been <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/health/selma-blair-multiple-sclerosis-instagram-post/>diagnosed with MS</a> following an emotional experience in a dressing room.</p><p class=fh>"I have #multiplesclerosis. I am in an exacerbation. By the grace of the lord, and willpower, and the understanding producers at Netflix, I have a job. A wonderful job. I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken GPS. But we are doing it. And I laugh, and I don't know exactly what I will do precisely, but I will do my best," she <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BpKjP_7FnWQ>shared</a>.</p><p class=fh>Although the actress's diagnosis came later in life, she recalled having symptoms of MS—like waking up in the middle of the night and hysterically laughing, hysterically crying and not knowing why, or passing out and waking up with no idea where she is—since she was a little girl.</p><p class=fh>Blair's first public appearance following her emotional announcement about her diagnosis was at the 2019 Vanity Fair after-party. And much to the shock of some, <a class="Ed a" href=#>the actress </a>walked the red carpet with her cane, an object she saw as an "extension" of herself.</p><p class=fh>Appearing on the cover of British Vogue without her beloved cane was out of the question, Blair shared, adding that she hoped to contribute to the representation of disabled people. "If I can help remove stigma or over-curiosity in a crowd for someone else, then that's great," she <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/selma-blair-british-vogue-interview>said</a>.</p><p class=fh>However, <a class="Ed a" href=#>the "Purple Violets" star</a> faced backlash in her pursuit of spreading awareness and revealed that she was accused of being "narcissistic" for speaking about her experience. <a class="Ed a" href=#>Selma Blair</a> <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/health/selma-blair-responds-to-trolls-who-call-her-narcissistic-for-posting-about-multiple-sclerosis/>shared</a>, "We're not accustomed to thinking outside of our own social group. That was an awakening for me [to see] how much people didn't realize a lot of what they think is my narcissism is just becoming more aware of other people's needs."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nbG1maHq0scummGaanJa2s3nPq6aunJyueqK8z56Yq6tdpLtuws6grJ5mmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-deere-1530.html><span>←</span><span>John Deere 1530 HP, Price, Specs, Weight, Review 2022</span></a>
