She accessorized minimally, adding only a pair of starburst diamonds earring and a matching ring to her bombshell look. As for glam, she styled her caramel-highlighted hair in loose waves with a middle part and sported a dark pink lip and smoky eye makeup.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joining Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen, Ed O'Neill, Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson on stage, Vergara plugged her new Netflix show Griselda, which prompted a hilarious reaction from her castmates. When Burrell asked his co-stars if they missed being together, Bowen chimed in, revealing that being on a show for 11 seasons “never happens.” O'Neill then reminded everyone that it did happen to him, hinting at his run on Married With Children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vergara added her own bragging rights: “Yeah, my new show&nbsp;Griselda&nbsp;is also, for a month already, No. 1 in 90 countries." Stonestreet interjected and asked Ferguson to pay up, "I told you she'd mention it in the first 10 seconds," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Watch the entire reunion in the video below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qidopldq7Kzs8CrmGaln5mys7qMn5imoZyuerOx1KegqKZdZ31zgIysmKBlkayus7DSZm9ucWlugHU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./big-sean-ft-kanye-west-marvin-gaye-chardonnay.html><span>←</span><span>Big Sean ft.
