(H/t Andrew Thompson of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POST Wrestling</a> for the transcription.)</p><p>“I honestly think they (WWE) didn’t believe in me. You know, producers, TJ (Wilson) was a very big advocate for me and he would always be like, ‘Dana can do it, Dana can do it, Dana can do it’ and it just — it wasn’t happening and I wasn’t that girl. I wasn’t the girl that they were trying to push to that next level. (I) was the one that I was always given to take the pin fall and I was okay with it, thinking in my mind, there’s gonna be a shot. There’s gonna be that next time and there just never was that next time.”</p><h2 id=h-money-in-the-bank>Money In The Bank</h2><p>“I fought so hard. I’ll never forget this and I think it was 2018 or ‘19 in the Money in the Bank match where I wanted to hang from the briefcase and swing from it and fall and a pile of girls catch me and they’re like, ‘No, no, no. That’s a little too dangerous.’ I’m like, ‘Do you not know I was in gymnastics for 18 years? And the bar was this high. I would do double backflips and layoffs out from underneath the bars. I promise you, I’m okay. Just let me do it’ and it would be a wow factor and I just don’t think that they had the confidence in me.”</p><p>Brooke was in the 2019 women’s Money in the Bank ladder match that was won by Bayley. She was a 15-time WWE 24/7 Champion and was last seen on NXT at the time of her release.</p><p><a href=#>Ash By Elegance (Dana Brooke): You’re Going To See A New Side Of Me In TNA</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsbmpwZmKutLSMm7BmnZyatKK6wp5knZmelnqjvs6oop5llKSytLrTZpmepJmaw6Z51rCcZqCRmXqku82foJ2dnpiybrXNZp%2Beql2ouKq4y6w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./are-seasons-1-3-of-young-sheldon-on-netflix-6190-html.html><span>←</span><span>Are Seasons 1-3 of Young Sheldon on Netflix?</span></a>
