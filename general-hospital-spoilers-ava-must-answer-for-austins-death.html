Apparently, Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober) has close ties to Austin’s mother Charity Gatlin (Gloria Carlin). It was revealed that Cyrus even paid Austin’s way through medical school, thus ensuring he became a doctor.</p><p>In return, Austin was forced to work for Cyrus secretly for years.

But Austin had apparently had enough and went to the authorities to reveal the truth about his connection to Cyrus and his criminal empire.</p><p>He wanted to offer a plea deal but the authorities said they needed proof, which Austin left to retrieve at his cabin in Pautauk. But someone shot Austin and left him for dead, destined to bleed out alone in his own home.</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers – News Of Austin Gatlin-Holt’s Fate Will Soon Spread!</h3><p><a href=#>Once word gets out that Austin was shot</a>, look for suspicion to fall on Ava. She’s been seen many times in public associating with Austin. And now that she knows Austin was working for Cyrus all along, she may have decided to resort to murder to get revenge.</p><p>But it’s much more likely that Cyrus himself shot Austin in order to keep him quiet. Austin’s death may finally give him some validity within the Quartermaine family as well, so look for everyone in Port Charles to have an active interest in who killed the son of Jimmy Lee Holt!</p><h3>What Do You Think?</h3><p>Who shot Austin?
