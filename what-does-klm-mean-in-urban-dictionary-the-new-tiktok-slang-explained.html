Unlike the real meaning of calm, soothing, tranquil, or an absence of intense emotion, netizens used the word to reply that they are fine.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-klm-mean-on-tiktok></span>What Does KLM Mean On TikTok?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>KLM has taken over TikTok as of recently though its meaning is little changed as of currently. TikTok’s KLM means the abbreviation of “Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V” or KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.</p><p>KLM is an airline company that has got in a business feud with another airline company, Ryanair. KLM recently received a €3.4 billion support relief package commission from the European Commission in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Meanwhile, Raynair decided to sue KLM as they said that the commission is” unfair, illegal and distorts the market.” Raynair is a relatively small company in comparison to KLM.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-klm-a-slang></span>Is KLM A Slang?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>KLM’s social media version of saying ‘calm’ is indeed slang. Though it seems that the real reason for KLM on TikTok as of now is not slang but a short form of the airlines.</p><p>It is not known when will the legal battles between KLM and Raynair will settle down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFusM6eqmajnKJ6rrHAp2Sipl2qv6OtzWabopuknryvrdGyZK2glWK7psOMraCkrJ%2BgerS4wKeeZp2opbmitc2em2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ernest-lee-thomas-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Ernest Lee Thomas Net Worth 2024</span></a>
