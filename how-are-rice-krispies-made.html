No, I’m not talking about your sassy, soggy, talking pancakes. I’m talking about Rice Krispies! Rice Krispies lore and history runs deep. I grew up watching those elves, Snap, Crackle, and Pop and eating those gooey, marshmallowy Rice Krispie treats. But what are Rice Krispies made of? And why do all those TikTok people eat rice Krispies before working out? Let’s pop the questions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-were-rice-krispies-invented><strong>When were Rice Krispies invented?</strong></h2><p>Rice Krispies were invented and launched by Kellogg’s in 1928. A little over a decade later, a youth group called the Camp Fire Girls popularized Rice Krispie treats with their nationwide fundraiser. Those treats became so popular that Kellogg’s began printing the recipe on the cereal box.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-are-rice-krispies-made-and-what-are-they-made-of><strong>How are Rice Krispies made and what are they made of?</strong></h2><p>When it comes to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American breakfast cereal</a>, there’s a lot of puffing going around. There’s puffed corn and puffed wheat. Then there’s puffed dough, like every rabbit’s favorite cereal, Trix. Rice Krispies are made of puffed rice. Producers mix rice with a malt flavoring made of sugar, salt, and malt extract dissolved in water, then cook it at a super-high temperature until it “pops” like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popcorn</a>. When the rice puffs up under the heat, numerous little air-filled caves form inside. Then, when milk hits the Krispies, the starch absorbs the liquid and the air escapes from the caves, breaking the walls and making the snap, crackle, and pop sound.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-rice-krispies-vegan><strong>Are Rice Krispies vegan?</strong></h2><p>This simple cereal has to be vegan, right? Nope. Unfortunately for vegans, Rice Krispies are not vegan. One of the ingredients in the malt mixture is vitamin D3, which is derived from sheep’s wool, an animal product.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-rice-krispies-gluten-free><strong>Are Rice Krispies gluten free?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>That same malt syrup has a type of sweetener produced from barley, which means Rice Krispies are not gluten-free.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-do-rice-krispies-expire><strong>Do Rice Krispies expire?</strong></h2><p>Rice Krispies can expire. They aren’t going to go rotten like milk, but if you let them go too far past the expiration date, they will definitely be pretty stale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-do-people-eat-rice-krispies-before-working-out><strong>Why do people eat Rice Krispies before working out?</strong></h2><p>There’s been a trend on TikTok in which people push Rice Krispies or Rice Krispie treats as a great pre-workout snack. Why do people eat Rice Krispies before working out? Basically, the rice and sugar in Rice Krispies and Rice Krispie treats are simple carbohydrates, which hit the bloodstream fast and can provide a boost of energy during workouts or sports. That quick boost is great for high-energy workouts like an hour long kickboxing class or a basketball game. You could eat a banana instead, but banana eating won’t make you go viral or TikTok, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unless you eat it really cool</a>. I eat bananas sideways but it hasn’t gotten me any TikTok views yet. Maybe I’ll try Rice Krispies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKCfrHqivsRmqaKblWK4s7XSqaCeq12irqWxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gods-of-egypt-2016.html><span>←</span><span>Gods of Egypt movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</span></a>
