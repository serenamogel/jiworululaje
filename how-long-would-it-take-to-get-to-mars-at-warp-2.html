This means the Voyager series used the old method of Warp calculation. 70,000/9.9753 is roughly 71 years.<h2>How long does it take 2 get to Mars?</h2>According to NASA, a one-way trip to Mars would take about nine months. If you wanted to make it a round-trip, all in all, it would take about 21 months as you will need to wait about three months on Mars to make sure Earth and Mars are in a suitable location to make the trip back home.<h2>How long is a year on Mars?</h2>The Earth zips around the Sun at about 67,000 miles per hour, making a full revolution in about 365 days - one year on Earth. Mars is a little slower, and farther from the sun, so a full circuit takes 687 Earth days - or one Mars year.<h2>How long does it take to get to Mars? - BBC News</h2><p></p><h2>How cold is Mars?</h2>Temperatures on Mars average about -81 degrees F. However, temperatures range from around -220 degrees F. in the wintertime at the poles, to +70 degrees F.<h2>How many mph is warp 1?</h2>According to the Star Trek Encyclopedia, in simple terms, the new warp speed factor 1 is the exact speed of light, 299,792,458 m/s.<h2>Why is warp 10 Impossible?</h2>Our solution was to redraw the warp curve so that the exponent of the warp factor increases gradually, then sharply as you approach Warp 10. At Warp 10, the exponent (and the speed) would be infinite, so you could never reach this value.<h2>How far is Vulcan from Earth?</h2>The Real Vulcan:<p>This system is some 16 light-years from Earth, which is about 94 trillion miles (151 trillion km) away. Unfortunately, it would take us nearly 81,000 years to reach the *closest* star.</p><h2>How fast is Lightspeed?</h2>Light from a stationary source travels at 300,000 km/sec (186,000 miles/sec).<h2>Is warp speed a real thing?</h2>“None of the physically conceivable warp drives can accelerate to speeds faster than light,” Bobrick says. That is because you would require matter capable of being ejected at speeds faster than light—but no known particles can travel that fast.<h2>Can anything go faster than light?</h2>So, according to de Rham, the only thing capable of traveling faster than the speed of light is, somewhat paradoxically, light itself, though only when not in the vacuum of space. Of note, regardless of the medium, light will never exceed its maximum speed of 186,282 miles per second.<h2>What speed is warp 8?</h2>The crew of the Enterprise measures velocity in warp factors. Warp factor 8 equals the cube of 8 (8 times 8 times 8), or 512 times light speed. Even this velocity is too slow to allow starships to travel as quickly as they appear to on TV.<h2>Is warp drive faster than light?</h2>A warp drive is a device that distorts the shape of the space-time continuum. A spacecraft equipped with a warp drive may travel at speeds greater than that of light by many orders of magnitude.<h2>Is NASA working on warp drive?</h2>NASA is obviously still working out the kinks of their warp drive, but perhaps it's only a matter of time before at least neighboring star systems, like Proxima Centauri, will be in reach for human crews. Until then, we can only look at the furthest stars using our telescopes. ⓒ 2021 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.<h2>Do dilithium crystals exist?</h2>In reality, dilithium (Li2) is a molecule composed of two covalently bonded lithium atoms which exists naturally in gaseous lithium. Dilithium is depicted as a valuable, extremely hard crystaline mineral that occurs naturally on some planets.<h2>What does NCC in Star Trek stand for?</h2>NCC is the Starfleet abbreviation for "Naval Construction Contract", comparable to what the U.S. Navy would call a hull number. Jefferies rejected 3, 6, 8, and 9 as "too easily confused" on screen; he eventually reasoned the Enterprise was the first vessel of Starfleet's 17th starship design, hence 1701.<h2>How fast can the Borg travel?</h2>The Borg's Transwarp Technology History<p>by 2374 - A vessel belonging to species 116 named the Dauntless was assimilated by the collective, it's quantum slipstream capable of speeds of at least 10,000 light-years per hour.</p><h2>What is faster warp speed or Lightspeed?</h2>In "Star Trek," a warp factor of 1 is light speed, and a warp factor of 9.9 is more than 2,000 times greater than light speed. But James O'Donoghue, a former NASA scientist who's now at JAXA, animated warp-speed velocities in the solar system using the Enterprise spaceship.<h2>How fast is impulse?</h2>The Star Trek Voyager Technical Manual, page 13, has full impulse listed as ¼ of the speed of light, which is 167,000,000 mph or 74,770 km/s. One quarter impulse for Voyager would be 18,665 km/s. Voyager's one quarter impulse is 10 times faster than that of the shuttle.<h2>How far away is Deep space Nine from Earth?</h2>According to the official Star Charts, DS9 is roughly 63 light years away from Earth.<h2>Does it rain diamonds on Mars?</h2>“However, the diamonds are not quickly falling in a gaseous atmosphere like rain on Earth but sinking in a very dense and hot liquid that makes up the gigantic 'ice' layers inside those planets.” Unable to penetrate the rocky core, the diamonds would form a layer around it.<h2>How hot is space in direct sunlight?</h2>Which is why we have spacesuits: Apart from protecting you from vacuum, they protect you from being cooked. Objects in direct sunlight in Earth orbit get heated to around 120°C (248°F). And yet, there's a paradox: You also need spacesuits to protect you from being frozen. Even in Earth orbit, space can be very cold.<h2>Does it snow on Mars?</h2>Yes. In fact, snow has already been detected falling on Mars – though up in its atmosphere rather than settling on the ground. In 2008, NASA's Mars Phoenix Lander detected snow falling from clouds about 4km (13,000ft) above the planet's surface.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormakn6O0bsPOrqOdZZmperWtyp5kraddnLK1edOoZKaZoqh6osCMsJirqF1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dr-disrespect-cheating-wife-mrs-assassin-reddit.html><span>←</span><span>Dr Disrespect Cheating Wife Mrs Assassin Scandal And Reddit Drama</span></a>
