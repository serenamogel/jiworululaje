As a result, they decided to write out Polito's character at the end of Season 2. Fontana assured him that he would be brought back later in the season, but Polito was unhappy and criticized the producers publicly, an action he later regretted. The outburst caused a rift with Fontana and the Crosetti character was killed off early in Season 3, with the explanation that the detective had committed suicide. This further infuriated Polito, who again complained to the media, triggering a public slinging match between him and Fontana. Interviewed about the situation in 2005, Polito expressed regret for his handling of the matter. He noted that he and Fontana subsequently patched up their differences, and as a result the Crosetti character returned to make a farewell appearance as a spirit in <i>Homicide: The Movie</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeapLtuvM6loK2nXaOytXnWqKmtoF1shXJ8kw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./asgard-valhalla-guest-house-mossel-bay-south-africa.html><span>←</span><span>Asgard Valhalla Guest House, Mossel Bay, South Africa</span></a>
