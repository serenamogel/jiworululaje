Chip and dip combos are crunchy, customizable, and the flavor can vary from creamy to cheesy to spicy to garlicky to all of the above. All you need is a grocery store nearby and a dream. Since I know you already have a dream (everyone does; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tangled taught me that</a>), allow us to do the ideating, okay? Here is a list of the best chip and dip pairings we’ve found in our taste tests.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">On the Border Café Style Tortilla Chips</a> & <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hope Foods Spicy Green Chile Guacamole</a></strong><p>I mean, come on. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chips</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guac</a> are a classic—arguably the chips and dip combo. Especially when you use On the Border Café Style Tortilla Chips and Hope Foods Spicy Green Chile Guacamole, the best products we tasted in our tortilla chip and guacamole tastings, respectively. Why? Well, On the Border chips are the perfect saltiness for eating plain or dipping, and have a straight-out-of-the-fryer homemade taste to them. The guac is “deeply flavorful, spicy, and creamy,” according to Danny Palumbo, which is all you can really ask for in a guac. As well as some lime-y ness. But guess what—it has that, too!</p><p><strong>Read the full rankings of the <a href=#>best tortilla chips</a> and the <a href=#>best guacamole</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fritos Scoops Spicy Jalapeño</a> & <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Queso Mama White Queso with Diced Green Chilies</a></strong><p>When you’re in the chip aisle looking for a chip to pair with queso, you might be tempted to grab plain ol’ Fritos Scoops. Not a terrible choice—Scoops rule, don’t get me wrong—but you’d really be missing out on the boatloads of flavor these Spicy Jalapeño Fritos Scoops bring. “These corn chips are like big, crunchy, corn chip boats,” Sporked editor-in-chief <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Sterling</a> wrote. “They are seriously sizable, satisfying snacks. And oh, boy. That flavor. They have so much good jalapeño flavor with just a hint of spice at the end.” Paired with this creamy, dreamy, chili-spiked white queso? Snack time just got spicy, y’all.</p><p><strong>Read the full rankings of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best corn chips</a> and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best queso</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stacy’s Simply Naked Pita Chips</a> & <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Whole Foods 365 Roasted Garlic Hummus</a></strong><p>Oh, what’s this? Another one of the most classic chip and dip pairings? Well, it is on this list for a reason and that reason is simple: A snack of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pita chips</a> and garlicky <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hummus</a> is hard to beat. It’s got salt, protein, and umami out the wazoo—and it’s one of those chip and dip combos you can can pretend are healthy. Stacy’s Simply Naked Pita Chips impressed us with their buttery flavor and savory je ne sais quoi we couldn’t quite place (but loved!). Whole Foods 365 Roasted Garlic Hummus is simply, full stop, the best hummus. It is creamy, delicious, and bursting with lemon, sesame, and roasted garlic flavor. Put these two stunners together and you got yourself one of the best chip and dip pairings out there.</p><p><strong>Read the full rankings of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best pita chips</a> and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best hummus</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Original Ruffles</a> & <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion Dip</a></strong><p>This was a classic in my house growing up. There would always be a bowl of the Lipton French Onion Dip and a platter of veggies that also had a section just for Ruffles. People mostly ate the Ruffles and ignored the veggies but, hey, props to my parents for giving us a choice. Why is this combo of Original Ruffles and a creamy sour cream-based Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion Soup & Dip Mix so good? Because it basically tastes like sour cream and cheddar Ruffles but with more textural variation. The crispy, crunchy, wavy ruffles with the “creamy, cheese-like consistency” and rich onion flavor of the classic dip is truly impossible to beat. This is one of the best chips and dip options out there and I stand by that.</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best powdered dip mixes</a></strong></p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Salt & Fresh Ground Pepper Krinkle Cut Kettle Chips</a> & <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketside Spinach & Artichoke Dip</a></strong><p>I know y’all usually dip tortilla chips in your spinach artichoke dip, but hear me out: Salt & Fresh Ground Pepper Kettle Chips. All the crunch you want but with the little peppery kick you never knew you needed. Spinach and artichoke dip is delicious, especially our top pick, Marketside Spinach & Artichoke Dip from Walmart. It is so tangy, creamy, and cheesy (three cheesy, to be exact: mozzarella, parmesan, and asiago) that it needs something to cut through the richness, and a simple, elegant, peppery kettle chip is just the thing. Add this to your arsenal of chip and dip pairings and let us know if you like it!</p><p><strong>Read the full ranking of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best spinach dips</a> and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best Kettle chip flavors</a></strong></p><h2>Subscribe</h2><p>Get all the top food rankings, new product reviews, and other grocery content delivered to your inbox every other week.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>By clicking submit you agree to our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LANDING-PAGE_COOKOUT-WEEK_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-s-cookout-week-at-sporked><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s Cookout Week at Sporked!</a></h2><p>To kick off summer, we’re highlighting all the best foods and drinks you should be buying for cookouts, BBQs, grilling seshes, or any other type of al fresco partying and eating you’ll be doing this season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFur8eip2aZnpl6pbXPZqeaoaKeu6i%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matt-damon-denies-using-homophobic-slur-after-bizarre-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Matt Damon Denies Using Homophobic Slur After Bizarre Interview</span></a>
