When asked by a reporter about whether she meant to come out in the brand’s Power of Women cover story, the singer replied, “No I didn’t.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I kind of thought, ‘Wasn’t it obvious’? I didn’t realize people didn’t know,” Billie said. “I just don’t really believe in it. I’m just like, ‘Why can’t we just exist’? I’ve been doing this for a long time, and I just didn’t talk about it. Whoops.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “But I saw the article, and I was like, ‘Oh I guess I came out today.’ OK cool. It’s exciting to me because I guess people didn’t know, but it’s cool that they know. I am for the girls.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her November profile, published last month, Eilish opened up about her feelings for women, explaining that she “never really felt like I could relate to girls very well.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love them so much. I love them as people. I’m attracted to them as people. I’m attracted to them for real,” she explained. “I have deep connections with women in my life, the friends in my life, the family in my life. I’m physically attracted to them. But I’m also so intimidated by them and their beauty and their presence.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eilish’s comments come over six months after she ended her last public relationship with The Neighborhood frontman, Jesse Rutherford, in May of this year. The pair were first linked together in early Oct. 2022 before confirming their relationship weeks later on Halloween.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waKjpaGVYrKquMisn2aolaS9rbGMnaCdpqRiuK%2B71maqoZ1drK60edCunJ6qXauus7XErbBmm5%2BrsrN50q2mq7FdbYFyfJFvbA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lucas-connor-net-worth-302885.html><span>←</span><span>Lucas Connor Net Worth 2024</span></a>
