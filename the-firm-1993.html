<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The Firm movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1993)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Mitch moves to Memphis with his wife, Abby (<a href=#>Jeanne Tripplehorn</a>, the peculiar psychiatrist in "<a href=#>Basic Instinct</a>"). They are provided with a house and a shiny new Mercedes - both bugged, as it turns out. And gradually McDeere begins to realize his new law firm is in league with the devil. An FBI man spills the beans: only a quarter of the clients are above-board, and the rest are thieves, scoundrels and money-launderers, with the firm's partners acting as bagmen shipping the money to offshore banks.</p><p>Some movies about the law oversimplify the legal aspects.</p><p>This one milks them for all they're worth. Without revealing too much of the plot, I can say that McDeere is eventually being blackmailed simultaneously by both the FBI and the firm's security chief (kindly old <a href=#>Wilford Brimley</a>, very effective in a rare outing as a villain).</p><p>To save himself, he has to use both brain and muscle, outrunning killers and outthinking lawyers, to save both his life and his license to practice law.</p><p>The story is fairly clear in its general outlines, but sometimes baffling on the specifics. Based on the novel by <a href=#>John Grisham</a>, as adapted by three of the most expensive screenwriters in the business (<a href=#>David Rabe</a>, <a href=#>Robert Towne</a> and <a href=#>David Rayfiel</a>), "The Firm" takes 2 1/2 hours to find its way through a moral and legal maze. By the end, despite McDeere's breathless explanations during phone calls in the middle of a chase sequence, I was fairly confused about his strategy. But I didn't care, since the form of the movie was effective even when the details were vague.</p><p>Sydney Pollack, the director, likes to make long, ambitious movies ("Out Of Africa," "Havana") and he's comfortable working with familiar stars; he uses them as character-building shorthand. One glimpse of <a href=#>Hal Holbrook</a> as the head of the Firm, for example, and we know it's a shady outfit. Holbrook almost always plays the seemingly respectable man with dark secrets. One look at <a href=#>Gene Hackman</a>, as the law partner who becomes Cruise's mentor, and we know he's a flawed but fundamentally decent man, because he always is. One look at Cruise and we feel comfortable, because he embodies sincerity. He is also, in many of his roles, just a little slow to catch on; his characters seem to trust people too easily, and so it's convincing when he swallows the Firm's pitches and pep talks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55llp6%2FrnmQcnBs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofia-vergara-modern-family-reunion-2024-sag-awards-8599934.html><span>←</span><span>Sofia Vergara Reunited With Her 'Modern Family' Costars at the 2024 SAG Awards</span></a>
