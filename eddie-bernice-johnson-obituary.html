Her story of perseverance began at the VA hospital, where she faced blatant racism.</p><p>In a 2020 interview with The Dallas Morning News, Johnson recounted the overt racism she experienced at the VA hospital. Officials would precede her into patients’ rooms to announce her qualifications, highlighting the racial bias she confronted. Despite the adversity, Johnson chose not to quit, describing the experience as challenging but ultimately successful.</p><p>Eddie Bernice Johnson’s political career was characterized by a series of historic firsts. Elected in 1992, she became the first registered nurse to serve in the United States Congress.</p><p>Her dedication to public service extended beyond the national stage, with earlier stints in the Texas House of Representatives, where she was elected in a landslide victory in 1972, becoming the first black woman to hold electoral office from Dallas. Subsequently, she served three terms in the Texas Senate.</p><p>As the dean of Texas’s congressional delegation during the swearing-in of the 116th United States Congress, Johnson’s influence reached new heights. Upon the passing of Representative Don Young in March 2022, she became the oldest member of the House of Representatives.</p><p>Eddie Bernice Johnson’s retirement at the end of the 117th Congress marked the conclusion of a distinguished career marked by accomplishments, resilience, and a commitment to breaking down barriers for future generations.</p><p>Her impact on American politics, particularly for marginalized communities, will be remembered as a testament to the strength of character and dedication to justice that defined her life. In honoring her memory, we reflect on the trailblazing legacy left behind by a true pioneer in American politics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2UmbamecGeqaehk5p6q7vHp6qopl2kr6rA1Jqpsmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-bale-is-unrecognisable-thanks-to-weight-gain-for-new-movie.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Bale is unrecognisable thanks to weight gain for new movie</span></a>
