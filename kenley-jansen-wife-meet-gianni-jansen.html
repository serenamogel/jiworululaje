His mother works as a travel agent.</p><p>Because TBS in Curaçao carried the team’s games,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>grew up a Braves fan. Later, the squad also signed Jansen’s older brother Ardley and fellow Curaçaoan Andruw Jones.</p><p>At age six,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kenley Jansen</a>&nbsp;started playing baseball with his brothers. He started out playing outfield before switching to shortstop. After that,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was moved to third base and introduced to Andrelton Simmons.

On July 24 against the New York Mets, he made his Major League debut in relief, pitching a scoreless inning by retiring all three batters he faced and striking out two.</p><p><a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>rose to prominence in the Dodgers’ bullpen in 2011. In 53+2/3 innings, he was 2-1 with a 2.85 ERA and five saves. With 16+13 strikeouts per nine innings,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen</a> also set a new Major League season record by striking out 96 batters.</p><p>After Javy Guerra struggled in the position,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was named the Dodgers’ closer in May 2012. After missing a few games due to heart issues,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was replaced as a closer by Brandon League at the end of the season.</p><p>By agreeing to a $4.3 million contract with the Dodgers on February 11, 2014,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>was able to bypass his first arbitration hearing. 2014 saw&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>solidify his role as the Dodgers’ closer, pitching in 68 games with a 2.76 ERA, 101 strikeouts, and 44 saves.</p><p>He avoided arbitration once more on January 16, 2015, when he agreed to a one-year, $7.425 million deal with the Dodgers. He had surgery to remove a growth from a bone in his left foot, though, on February 17.</p><p>With his 162nd career save against the Washington Nationals on June 20, 2016,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>broke Éric Gagné’s all-time team record. His first all-star selection was to the National League squad for the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.</p><p>At Coors Field in Denver on April 7, 2019,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>made a four-out save against the Colorado Rockies.</p><p>By retiring Austin Nola of the San Diego Padres on August 25,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jansen&nbsp;</a>became the twelfth reliever in MLB history to reach 1,000 strikeouts.
