In fact, he died before the ride was ever completed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>MYTH: He was born in Robinson, Illinois.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Walt Disney is actually from Chicago. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>A reporter from Robinson, Illinois, claimed that Walt Disney had been <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>born in his town.</a></p><p>However, Walt Disney's official autobiography states that he was born in Chicago, as does <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>every other piece of writing</a> about him.</p><p>The <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>house where he was born still stands today</a>.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>MYTH: He left video instructions telling Disney executives what to do after he died.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>He did not leave video instructions. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>AP Photo</span></span></figure><p>As someone interested in the future, this actually does seem like something he might do, but there is <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>zero evidence</a> of this being the case.</p><p>Disney died in 1966 from lung cancer, and his death was relatively sudden and unexpected. When he died, Disney World was in the process of being built, and Disney's brother Roy decided to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>put off retirement</a> so he could personally watch over construction.</p><p>The brand was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>almost</a> bought out in the 1980s because the stock fell, and many of the movies during&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>this era</a> — dubbed "The Bronze Age" in the Disney movie canon — didn't do well at the box office.&nbsp;It took until the '90s for Disney to get its groove back, which is now known as the "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>The Disney Renaissance</a>." &nbsp;</p><p>So, Disney probably did not leave behind explicit instructions on next steps after his death.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>MYTH: He was an anti-Semite.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Walt Disney. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Associated Press</span></span></figure><p>The belief that Disney was antisemitic is so widespread that it's been addressed in pop culture, including being <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>spoofed in "Family Guy"</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>comments made</a> by Meryl Streep in 2014.</p><p>However, that has not been proven.</p><p>In "<a href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noindex" data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=831259b2f1e0d4a4605405ee59ea3b450ffacff8bb05f5d51d809292c23f161f&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWalt-Disney-Triumph-American-Imagination%2Fdp%2F0679757473" data-analytics-module=body_link>Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination,</a>"&nbsp;a biography&nbsp;written about Disney, the author <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>Neal Gabler states</a> that "of the Jews who worked [at Disney], it was hard to find any who thought Walt was an anti-Semite."</p><p>That said, the organization he was a founding member of, The Motion Picture Alliance, allegedly had many <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>privately&nbsp;anti-Semitic&nbsp;members</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, while there's no proof that Disney himself was anti-Semitic, some argue that he was complicit based on the company he kept.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>MYTH: He left money in his will for the first man who managed to get pregnant.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Walt Disney with his wife and two daughters, among other family members. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Evening Standard/Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>This might be the most random urban legend on this list. It's unclear <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>why or where this rumor began,</a> but it's persistent.</p><p>However, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>his will is public record</a>.&nbsp;He left 45% of his estate to his wife and daughters, 45% to the Disney Foundation, and the last 10% to be divided among his nieces, nephews, and sister.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>MYTH: He was born out of wedlock in Spain.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Walt and Mickey. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>AP Photo</span></span></figure><p>This story stems from the discredited biography "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince</a>." The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>theory</a> is that Disney was born out of wedlock in southern Spain, to a woman named Isabelle Zamora. The book also claims he was born in 1890 and later adopted by the Disneys.</p><p>Again, Disney was <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>born in Chicago</a>&nbsp;to Elias and Flora Disney, and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>no evidence exists</a> to support his illegitimate birth in Spain.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>MYTH: The Disney logo is his handwriting.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The Walt Disney logo. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Disney</span></span></figure><p>The Disney logo is a cultural touchstone. It is called a "Waltograph," and many believe it is Disney's handwriting, but unfortunately this is false.</p><p>While it's difficult to find out what Disney's signature actually looked like — there were a lot of people <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>authorized to sign</a> his name — the logo that we recognize as the Disney logo, in fact, didn't exist until well after his death, as it&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>first appeared</a> in 1984. Basically, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>it's a stylized version</a> of his signature, but not an exact copy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyuxdOhqmavkaHBbrDIrKWesV1nfXKDjGpp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yotam-ottolenghi.html><span>←</span><span>Yotam Ottolenghi</span></a>
