But according to <a href=#>RadarOnline</a>, that couldn't be further from the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking with a widowed mom of three who invited the reality star into her home for a reading, the outlet discovered that Caputo actually relies on help from her production team to get it just right. Meeting with Caputo's assistant a day before taping, the unnamed widow was asked "to tell her all about my husband's passing, so I did," she revealed. "She promised she wouldn't tell Theresa, but she totally could have told her everything."</p><p>Then came their encounter, which left a bad taste in the mom's mouth. "After our greeting, which we had to film twice because I didn't say the right things, Theresa brushed right past me and began talking to her crew," she recalled. "The crew knew what my husband looked like. They could have told Theresa about it when she first spoke with them."</p><p>Despite filming for a whopping six hours, she claims Caputo "didn't hit on anything surprising, and became very agitated and angry when I shut her down. I refused to fake it and cry 'Oh my God, you're right!'" she said, concluding, "I don't believe her. I think she's full of crap! I don't think she really gives a sh*t about the people she meets. It's all for the cameras."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampjbYV0e9Snq6iklGLBs8HToWStoJWnsrStjJyYqa2kpHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-franco-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>James Franco Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</span></a>
