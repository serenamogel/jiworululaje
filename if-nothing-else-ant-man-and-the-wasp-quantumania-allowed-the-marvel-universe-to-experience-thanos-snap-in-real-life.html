In this analogy, Thanos is the studio’s innate desire to oversaturate the MCU without caring whether <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they are serving mediocrity in its haste to produce content</a> — Marvel’s misconstrued idea of the greater good. And the most bankable heroes — Sam Wilson, Thor, Black Widow, Bucky Barnes, and Hulk — pose as the Infinity Stones who are used to exact the aforementioned agenda.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>And Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania proved to be the ultimate “Snap” — where Thanos erased half the living population, the film turned a number of things to dust:</p><h2 id=h-faith-that-the-mcu-is-equipped-to-tell-a-complicated-interlinked-web-of-stories-that-is-the-multiverse data-injectable=false>Faith that the MCU is equipped to tell a complicated, interlinked web of stories that is the multiverse&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Cassie-Lang-Ant-Man-e1676138105963.jpg><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>After all, it butchered the exploration of the Quantum Realm — the story could have taken place anywhere and it wouldn’t have made a lick of difference. The intricacies of the multi-dimensional realm were lost in Quantumania’s attempt to just haphazardly debut its new villain.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-hopes-that-marvel-knows-its-way-around-serving-good-cgi data-injectable=false>Hopes that Marvel knows its way around serving good CGI&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-modok-1.jpg><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>You don’t even have to look underline the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sloppy visual effects</a> in the rest of the film, just focusing on M.O.D.O.K., his giant head, and his butt is punishment enough. Heck, I still have nightmares about his twisted Minion buttocks.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-that-it-can-do-justice-to-minor-but-important-characters data-injectable=false>That it can do justice to minor but important characters…&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania.jpg><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>… Because boy, Quantumania did Darren Cross dirty. I mean, he could have been menacing, a mindless killer, or retained his old greed. But noooo, he had to be reduced to a comical and pointless sidekick who gets non-sensical lines. I thought Jane Foster’s “Let’s bring the rainbow” was bad, but MODOK’s dialogues and overall arc left me trying and failing to claw my way out of <a href=#>the depths of cringeness</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Oh, don’t even get me started on the Freedom Fighters — while Thor: Love and Thunder was dead set on being a parody, Quantumania was hellbent on turning every possible aspect of itself into a poor joke.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>And dear Marvel, the title said “and Wasp” — it means allowing Hope van Dyne to indulge in character development and not just be there for momentary glory or only be the force that drives the “hero.” I thought we left that in the past when Wanda single-handedly overpowered Thanos? Oh, I forgot, we villanized and micro-minimized her twice (WandaVision and WandaVision Part 2… I mean Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) for the blunder.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-marvel-s-finesse-in-debuting-memorable-villains data-injectable=false>Marvel’s finesse in debuting memorable villains</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-1.jpg><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=true>Okay, Majors was good as Kang, but he is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely not going down in history as a memorable baddie</a>. I mean, look at Hela, Loki, Red Skull, Ultron, and the best of them all, Thanos. They were all defeated, of course, but not in the insulting way the Conqueror got dispatched. Forget the ants that thwarted him, the poor guy was battling a mediocre script doing its lamest to look interesting throughout the film.</p><h2 id=h-mcu-s-ability-to-do-justice-to-its-existing-heroes data-injectable=false>MCU’s ability to do justice to its existing heroes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-4.jpg><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Yes, Ant-Man was always the “goofy” part of the MCU, and a hero who is the living personification of Captain America’s The Avenger rant, “Big man in a suit of armor, take that away and what are you?” And yes, his biggest contribution in Endgame was to suggest time travel to reverse the Snap (while other intelligent minds worked to flesh out the idea), and to make eyes at Hope as Thanos and his army steadily gained ground.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>But still, he is now one of the few remaining heroes that need to shoulder the MCU until the new ones gain enough trust to share the responsibility. So, his delivery of jokes that fall flat, and needing all the help in the whole wide Quantum Realm and Earth to thwart a villain isn’t exactly painting him as a reliable Avenger. Yeah, he gets the much-hyped The Kang as his enemy, but not only did the villain resemble a tantrum-throwing man-child, Scott Lang needed Hank, Janet, Hope, Cassie, the entire population of the Quantum Realm, and giant ants from Earth to even stand a chance of winning.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 — which is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">thankfully the last time we will see the Guardians together</a> — could have done some damage control if it hadn’t been James Gunn’s Marvel swan song. While it did redeem the MCU a bit, it majorly served as a trip down nostalgia lane to a time when the franchise liked exceeding expectations the good way, and only hammered in the fear that it is probably that last time we are seeing the good-old Marvel greatness.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now on Disney Plus and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the dwindling faith in the MCU</a> (when I said the fandom’s trust has been halved, that was me being generous) is more apparent than ever.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooJ9lnqTBqbXNoGSepKOaeqK602akmqZdlruledOhnGavkai9br3UmqWtrZ2Wu6qtjJqjpaenmrFuwMeeZKaZoquyrXnUp6CvnaKosm7AzmacsaiVp7amusKeZK2gkaO8tHnSp5ipZZmjerOxwKVkpaGWmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cpu-air-cooler-roundup-six-coolers-from-noctua-silverstone-and-cooler-master.html><span>←</span><span>Performance Results - CPU Air Cooler Roundup: Six Coolers from Noctua, SilverStone, be quiet!, and C</span></a>
