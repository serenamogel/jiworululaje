This is a squad comprised of the best eleven players of the year. EA Sports decides on this list, but there will also be the twelfth man as voted in by the community of FIFA players.</p><p>Familiar faces will surely return, such as Messi, Ronaldo, and MBappé are almost certain to make the cut, but we are looking forward to seeing if any newcomers manage to enter the FIFA 23 Team of the Year this time.&nbsp;</p><p>And that's everything you need to know about the TOTY in FIFA 23!</p><p><strong>Main Image via <a href=#>fifplay.com</a></strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/z1cTS-enwwhYqlnwWCS8SitvlINly2F-XrRVJ4F17O8/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy9ydWVsLnBuZw alt="Ruel Butler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3CyyJ%2BYZmpjZMGwwNhmraislWK%2FprjEmqqeZZSWwaY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./which-characters-are-playable-in-one-piece-odyssey.html><span>←</span><span>Which characters are playable in One Piece Odyssey?</span></a>
