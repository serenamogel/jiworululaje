At the time of their relationship, culminating in their secret 2003 marriage, Paltrow was still thriving via her Oscar-winning efforts in "Shakespeare In Love," while Martin's band Coldplay became superstars courtesy of their signature hit "Yellow." To their fans, it was the perfect union of movies and music, with subsequent arrivals of daughter Apple and son Moses adding to the bliss.</p><p>Or so it seemed. Paltrow's 2013 interview with <a href=#>Self</a>&nbsp;didn't hint at marital issues, but suggested that relationships take a lot of work. "You're not learning anything unless you're having the difficult conversations," she said. "Dealing with things directly changed my relationships. Sometimes when you get clear about who you are, others get less comfortable because they liked who you were. It's changed my marriage, too, but he's up for the challenge."&nbsp;</p><p>That challenge lasted only another year, when the couple announced their breakup that they colloquially dubbed "conscious uncoupling."&nbsp;In <a href=#>Vogue</a>, Paltrow said she got the phrase from her therapist and even though she thought it was a trite description, she and Martin felt it was the proper route to take. "It's very different for every couple but, for me, it meant, more than anything, being accountable for my own part in the dissolution of the relationship," Paltrow added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampmbIZ0gI5rZ2loo2KwprjEm6mirKlisLDBz6WcrGWiqrmmsIyhpqWkqay8sLCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-scents-repel-bed-bugs.html><span>←</span><span>What scents repel bed bugs?</span></a>
