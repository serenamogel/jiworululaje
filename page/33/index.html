It struck me as odd that there was no legendary trio (new for this generation). I loved the inclusion of Mewtwo, but it did feel like the legendaries were lacking, until we found out about the hidden legendaries, bringing the total up to 6. The original Red/Blue/Yellow only have 4/5 legendaries (whether you count Mew, or not, what with it's almost impossible to obtain status), and G/S/C only had 5/6 (whether you count Celebi or not, what with it's almost impossible to obtain status outside of Japan).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sergio Castellitto movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jun 18, 2024</time>

I can't precisely define an Art Film, but I knew I was seeing one when I saw these.

<a href=../../matcha.html></a>
Matcha treats – I can hardly remember my life without them. Since we’ve been in Japan, matcha ice cream, matcha doughnuts, and matcha cakes have become daily afternoon snacks. This matcha smoothie, I promise, is a much healthier treat than any of those. Sure matcha is healthy, but a doughnut is still a doughnut after all. At home, this is how we enjoy matcha. I use my go-to smoothie base – almond milk and bananas – and add matcha powder along with a bit of vanilla bean.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Carnie Wilson Bio, Marriage, Children, Income, Net worth</h2><time>Jun 17, 2024</time>
